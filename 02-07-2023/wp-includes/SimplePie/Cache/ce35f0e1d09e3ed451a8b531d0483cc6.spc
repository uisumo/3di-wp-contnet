<p>It&#8217;s time to build out your course. You&#8217;ve purchased and installed LearnDash and have all your content, but there is a critical decision to make before getting started.</p>



<p>How should you structure your content to maximize learner engagement and course sales?&nbsp;</p>



<p>LearnDash, like all top Learning Management Systems, has a content hierarchy. So rather than having a flat learning experience where you move from one lesson to another, you can group content into sections, lessons, and lesson topics.</p>



<p>The structure of your content plays a significant role in the experience and marketability of your courses&#8211; it&#8217;s worth doing right.</p>



<p>This article will cover the LearnDash content hierarchy, the psychological principles influencing learner engagement and sales, and how to identify the right structure for your course content.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start by discussing the LearnDash content hierarchy.</p>



<h2 id="h-learndash-content-hierarchy">LearnDash Content Hierarchy</h2>



<p>As previously discussed, LearnDash segments content into sections, lessons, topics, and quizzes. This segmentation allows you to group your content into themes and smaller, more manageable bites. Below you&#8217;ll see a screenshot representing each segment.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Q99p38XV39ONCR04zwjcQ_G7EYCuOyBpaC31TQHkvi6V7WmkUlU3yLXVoHXBj-50a-ZpDY-exKgf3Ogp83rQGTTfC01NFgnsAXxowZAum9G3b3QxeUnaP-UGSJ4x1yb8mOzpQ6_kIVwqxjdLvOd8a8Ot0T5txTVRfM2HOWJS3IsVqz4dXWpXPrW_pFNptA" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Let&#8217;s cover each segment in more detail.</p>



<h3 id="h-lessons">Lessons</h3>



<p>Lessons are the highest content in the LearnDash hierarchy. When learners start a course, their first action is moving into the first lesson. They then work through each subsequent lesson until the course is complete.</p>



<p>If you have a simple course, you might only have lessons.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-sections">Sections</h3>



<p>Sections are simply groups of lessons. In short, adding a section allows you to split lessons visually with a heading in-between. There are advantages to this which influence both sales and engagement, which we&#8217;ll discuss below.</p>



<h3 id="h-topics">Topics</h3>



<p>Topics are children of lessons. They behave much like lessons in terms of capability but are only accessible by first navigating into the parent lesson. Topics allow you to split longer lessons into more manageable, multi-step bites, which can increase engagement.</p>



<h3 id="h-quizzes">Quizzes</h3>



<p>Quizzes can appear in several places within the LearnDash content hierarchy. For example, they can be at the top level alongside lessons, be a child of a lesson (similar to topics,) or be a child of a topic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only factor to note is quizzes at the lesson level can only occur at the end of a course. Therefore, if you want a quiz to occur before or after a lesson, it must be a child quiz.</p>



<h3 id="h-assignments">Assignments</h3>



<p>Assignments are instances where users must submit a file or answer an open-ended question to proceed. That file can be auto-approved or manually approved. Lessons and topics can have assignments. Segments cannot, however, because they don&#8217;t have a dedicated page. Instead, they&#8217;re just a visual break between lessons.</p>



<p>Now that you understand the LearnDash content structure let&#8217;s talk about the psychological factors influencing how best to map your content into this hierarchy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-design-psychology">Design Psychology</h2>



<p>The ideal course content hierarchy is influenced by psychology. Upon seeing your course outline, learners and prospects will make assumptions and judgments about the value and complexity of your course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They&#8217;re less likely to buy if the course structure doesn&#8217;t facilitate a straightforward assessment of course value. Similarly, they&#8217;re unlikely to buy if the format makes the course feel overwhelming or complex.</p>



<p>From an existing learner&#8217;s standpoint, the course structure directly impacts how engaging the course is and can be the difference between a course completion or abandonment.</p>



<p>There are three primary psychological principles at play:</p>



<ul><li>Chunking</li><li>Progressive Disclosure</li><li>Gamification</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-chunking">Chunking</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s easier to process and consume large amounts of information when grouped into common themes. For example, if I asked you to remember the following list, you would likely struggle:</p>



<ol><li>Carrots</li><li>Hamburger</li><li>Oranges</li><li>Brocolli</li><li>Watermelon</li><li>Celery</li><li>Strawberries</li><li>Pork chops</li><li>Bacon</li></ol>



<p>However, if I break it into groups, it&#8217;s much more manageable.</p>



<p><strong>Vegetables</strong></p>



<ol><li>Carrots</li><li>Brocolli</li><li>Celery</li></ol>



<p><strong>Proteins</strong></p>



<ol><li>Hamburger</li><li>Pork chops</li><li>Bacon</li></ol>



<p><strong>Fruits</strong></p>



<ol><li>Oranges</li><li>Watermelon</li><li>Strawberries</li></ol>



<p>Sections and topics allow you to group content into themes. Like the grouping above, this reduces the cognitive load to process the themes and concepts taught in the course. In turn, the course is more manageable for existing learners, and potential buyers better understand the course value.</p>



<p>Consider these two examples, lesson with and without the segments:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/wEA0nWfCWG6T8oOfVqW2DOjze8Jcnzi3-6-UMs8DRPuF54p29RV3a50gBgvxFoE-BNZ1mWk71D-Lhcw91kOF7Z-LDK37NuYyKu1h6vPDiXbtonY0Sz65laevWXEmAxwsr-GRvefCE-JK21a4i3kORTblvAj66c4zsSTA6OPEqMqWaU3HIaGm652ICrJidw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>and&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NmpCVl2U6l81-DvRZ3mnYSE-6BWWR8cy_icHBCyyX7CnO2_k1_zmWkaaSmntpApyyRZhfkfKALfdUkSzeMOOlsC1xdy5Po-RfEC4rJ0VpBKoeA9BIEU_pE6_N_-Ln0vvbTWUg3d7XkGTQkHv8IswRJ4jydN1SvCanQUN3yzoEdmKETjBIM5IPyuty6COiw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Which is easier to process and understand? The second example.</p>



<p>A related and equally important psychological principle is &#8220;Progressive Disclosure,&#8221; let&#8217;s dive in.</p>



<h3 id="h-progressive-disclosure">Progressive Disclosure</h3>



<p>Progressive disclosure is a concept where it&#8217;s easier to process information when you are exposed to high-level information initially and can opt to see more detail when desired.</p>



<p>An example would be an archive of blog posts on your website. You typically wouldn&#8217;t display each entire post on a single page. Instead, you have the most pertinent information, like the title and short description, with a link to show the full post.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using summaries instead of the entire post makes it easier to identify all the topics discussed on the blog, and decide which to interact with and see more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/pHrqmiKyBnlF9xKDKVYorSt2b622rXUuV1abvMdzL6WWtFuXy3mtZmZCSq7RpqL6_s7pSgMJRVjyCQ6x0qRUfQ2d7aAu-82wabFfehwr4ftWIZO75Ou7QwpQPyuuffu_SSffg_ZOjo3rLMYe-STl4V85MV_1jQf8QO-PW_iJPrj0IaS7d8m2xGTytTh_qA" alt=""/></figure>



<p>You can use progressive disclosure in your course through topics and child quizzes. Your lessons become the highest-level concepts, and learners can expand the lesson to see more detailed concepts.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s expand on our previous example above:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8prLREcjtv1hTS5YwLNmX6-ttYSf6nZovfia0l02zjMbvFt0Q1G6TdNAkgOrY3APlk9av8taobvRvqggyKekBDUwHl_l-_dYuILVLL3DKvWscoo6eMdeK0GnbLc1blgKS4xJtNK-G-dg6s0-mnrid1vlTKUL57V3Wj5-EzOALqSS--7fGJy5I8EfJaCAPw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Like chunking, it&#8217;s easier for prospects to comprehend the core concepts taught in your course, increasing the likelihood of buying. In addition, for existing learners, the course feels less overwhelming as there are fewer steps to focus on at a given time.</p>



<h3 id="h-gamification">Gamification</h3>



<p>You can use two gamification principles to shape your course structure, &#8220;Investment Loops&#8221; and &#8220;Appropriate Achievements.&#8221;</p>



<p>Making progress within a course (like completing a section, lesson, topic, or quiz) activates our reward centers. We&#8217;re making progress toward a goal, and it feels good. The more you can trigger this positive feeling, the more motivated learners will be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Triggering our reward center is a balance. For example, the Appropriate Achievements principle states that to trigger reward feelings, the next step must be difficult enough to feel challenging but not so difficult it feels unobtainable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In execution, each step of your course should be just long and complex enough to challenge the learner but short enough to feel immediately achievable. So rather than an extended lesson that covers 3 &#8211; 5 complex concepts, you have a single lesson with 3 &#8211; 5 topics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now you have a handful of steps that will take 3 &#8211; 5 minutes instead of one that will take 15 &#8211; 20. As a result, learners can tackle one or two quickly, which feels rewarding, vs. needing more time or energy to complete one more significant step.</p>



<p>This approach also triggers an &#8220;Investment Loop,&#8221; where you feel fulfilled for completing a step but still want more. As a result, learners are more likely to complete three 5min steps than one 15min one.</p>



<p>Pro tip! Visually indicating how long a step will take is a great way to increase learner engagement. <a href="https://snaporbital.com/learndash-visual-customizer/">Visual Customizer for LearnDash</a> allows you to do so in minutes!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sRgQKj4jTwJXs-_Omayl8dXV-V5U09LHO3F3zOrnEZZ2HCpKqsRdt0UKdUL2Wq_u46Wv0Bf_65BIC47E7sKYBDwxKrO4q416yoWEgnId0TGmeVaTFSLMhsbDZfM0DdR_1_9LMKgA0Mrc1DWrzE6uC1mP4JndmoVUyc2-3L8_ftAMIE3JLYgFJeseyaU2pA" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Now that you understand the psychology behind segmenting your content into sections, lessons, topics, and quizzes, let&#8217;s cover how to identify the optimal course content structure.</p>



<h2 id="h-creating-your-content-outline">Creating Your Content Outline</h2>



<p>Before you populate any content in LearnDash, I recommend creating a &#8220;content outline,&#8221; a collection of bulleted lists that identify the sections, lessons, topics, and quizzes.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-broad-themes">Broad Themes</h3>



<p>First, start by creating a list of the major themes or concepts the course will teach learners. If you end up with more than 10, I&#8217;d recommend seeing if you could combine them into a more generalized theme.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/V7HcCgMl-oKtAGb1IMl4B_5u-_K09duOtlLpRmNSwLLp80AHJULqNzRRPhi35XoXLI_qQmwWkUvXjghjLjHEvWB4iaHHhwMFQj8iGwKeNzQ6BSGgV-PhCBYwyfGriQTeTnvfCn5oEoGhFd800gLrjfSNyGsjDU3RwKDKgIB3ZqSn3SEZxQQsKWSdYtOREQ" alt=""/></figure>



<h3 id="h-primary-and-sub-concepts">Primary and Sub Concepts</h3>



<p>Then, within each of the 3 &#8211; 7 broad themes, create a nested list of the 3 &#8211; 7 concepts within those themes.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4HlU_lKhbHk7x8uAShLZpKlAq9qcKHGopeAHV-nZx6Gul_BxfbahVbLbV3cT1jCXfDH95ZoZ4nvouLeL1Tnnc3I-ad0SwQNYwuHZc1qPbyq0z3fY9D8K4by15Z7WPlpb0aNT-y7kFvJHNuCg37aBh10xXYcpGBL2HatQ_iUxRTJnnrm0LK3aQFPgym1eew" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Now evaluate each idea and assess how long it would take to fully explain the concept to someone who knew nothing about it. If the answer is more than 5 &#8211; 7 minutes, then you need another layer of hierarchy. Split your 3 &#8211; 7 sub-concepts into another 3 &#8211; 7 sub-sections.</p>



<p>If you need more than seven sub-sub sections or find it would still take longer than 5minutes to explain, consider splitting this one course into several focused courses.</p>



<h3 id="h-sections-or-topics">Sections or Topics</h3>



<p>Now you have between two and three layers in your content hierarchy. You&#8217;ll use sections, lessons, and topics if you have three layers.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_8WCQ-bAjaXL3b0L7N-pWnVMG_snRr7fC71IqaZfU9pJkwUMs_AA9tVk1Fn_7_3-5uOOTgxIEjw8B8OIyrsckuLmGAv7C-iGshv2KBNflOwfR2ZlF1INf_Wz2IrT0wRr0xQoq9wEe5WPY_c6HqOAKWPhq4_mag-GUCGvl28aLyYFSDDc6MWODIIWHT7xaA" alt=""/></figure>



<p>You must choose topics or sections for your hierarchy if you only have two.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d look at it like this: your lessons are like your book table of contents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The table of contents is a significant factor in the decision to purchase a book. Similarly, users will scan your list of lessons to decide if they want to buy. So there is some advantage to having more lessons provided you can keep it from overwhelming. For example, 15 lessons split into three sections will better &#8220;sell&#8221; your course than three lessons with five topics each (because more information is hidden.)</p>



<p>You now have a complete strategy to populate and segment your content into LearnDash!</p>

<p>Here are five ways to take advantage of Black Friday and Cyber Monday for your online course business.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-create-an-irresistible-offer">Create an irresistible offer</h2>



<p>When most people first think of creating an irresistible offer, they automatically think about drastically discounting the price of their product or service. In reality, an irresistible offer is simply a strategic structuring of your products and/or services where the value exceeds the costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some ways to create an actionable offer:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Bundling. </strong>Think of packaging valuable courses together at an attractive price for customers that still means high sales for you.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Value adds.</strong> You could add in personal one-on-one coaching, a free session, office hours, or early access to make a high-value offer that’s more than a discount.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Risk Reversal.</strong> This means that your course will provide the results promised without risk to the customer. This is mostly seen as a “money back guarantee” policy or the first lesson free. This can reduce hesitation at purchase.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Segmentation.</strong> Create different offers based on purchase history. For example, existing customers don’t need a great deal on your intro courses, but may be more interested in continuing education opportunities you provide.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Time limit. </strong>A timer on an offer compels people to act fast. Make your coupon window narrow with “early bird” and “last chance” incentives to create a sense of urgency.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-start-building-excitement-now">Start building excitement now</h2>



<p>In the days leading up to your Black Friday sale, your messages should get your audience excited and looking forward to your special offer. You want them clearly aware that you&#8217;re coming out with a Black Friday promotion.</p>



<p>A great way to build buzz is with a “Pre Launch” page. This can start as a “Coming Soon” page that will be changed to a “Special Offer” page as soon as your promotion officially goes live.</p>



<p>When thinking of what to add to a prelaunch/landing page, consider the following:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>A catchy headline and clear copy:</strong> Make sure you are clearly describing your course and stating your value proposition. Be urgent and catchy, but also direct and clear, to compel sign-ups.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Visual elements:</strong> add pictures, a sneak peek of your content, and if you have it, a video.</li><li><strong>Clear call to action: </strong>a CTA (call to action) refers to the link button where visitors can purchase your deals. It is important that all your CTAs are clearly visible and accessible anywhere on your landing page to make it easy for your potential customers.</li><li><strong>Social proof elements:</strong> if you have collected reviews from your past students, add them to your landing page to reinforce the value of your offer.</li><li><strong>A place to collect email addresses</strong>: if your deal is not live yet, add a place for potential customers to add their emails and get notified about your Black Friday offer. After Black Friday, the form could be a newsletter sign-up.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Refund Policy</strong>: Sentences like &#8220;Money Back Guaranteed&#8221; or &#8220;Risk-Free&#8221; will inform your customers about the refund policy and reassure even the most cautious buyers.</li><li><strong>Contact Information: </strong>Provide a way for potential learners to reach out to you so you can offer them a feeling of security and improve your image as the course creator.</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-create-an-email-sales-series">Create an Email Sales Series</h2>



<p>You can’t just send one email for Black Friday and one email for Cyber Monday anymore. Driving the most sales from your emails requires a well-thought-out strategy and plan. You need to build excitement through pre-Black Friday and Cyber Monday emails.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are the five emails we think you should send for Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Email 1 </strong>(2 weeks before Black Friday): Announce that something big is coming</li><li><strong>Email 2 </strong>(a few days later): Reveal the upcoming offer</li><li><strong>Email 3 </strong>(a week before Black Friday): Launch the offer with a clear, clickable coupon code</li><li><strong>Email 4</strong> (on Black Friday): Offer reminder</li><li><strong>Email 5 </strong>(A few days after): Offer ending – last chance</li></ul>



<p>Make your emails short and to the point with easily visible CTAs. Consider adding a countdown to your emails as well.&nbsp; Make your email stand out with value-driven subject lines, rather than “Black Friday Sale” or “Our Biggest Sale.”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-set-up-abandoned-cart-recovery">Set Up Abandoned Cart Recovery</h2>



<p>Cart abandonment is when shoppers add items to their cart but don’t complete the purchase. Following up on abandoned carts allows you to recover lost profit by sending reminder emails or follow-up messages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Visitors abandon their carts for several reasons:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Additional fees not shown on your course landing page</li><li>Complicated checkout process with too many steps</li><li>Security concerns (is this website safe?)</li><li>Unclear fulfillment instructions (How soon can purchasers access the course?)</li><li>Technical issues or website glitches</li></ul>



<p>If you’re using the <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/woocommerce/">WooCommerce shopping cart integration with LearnDash, </a>then you can set up an abandoned cart strategy in minutes. You can use a plugin or email service as well to set up a trigger for abandoned cart emails.</p>



<p>Or, you can try to avoid cart abandonment altogether: think of auto-applying coupons, adding live chat to your website, and offering different payment options. If you create these trust elements at checkout, users will convert more often.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-extend-your-offer-to-giving-tuesday">Extend Your Offer to Giving Tuesday</h2>



<p>Giving Tuesday is a global movement encouraging people to spread generosity through philanthropy. Giving Tuesday takes place every year on the Tuesday following Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. You can incorporate Giving Tuesday into your Black Friday / Cyber Monday strategy by extending your original offer through end-of-day Tuesday, with a portion of your Tueaday profits going towards charity.</p>



<p>Craft a custom email that will go out on Giving Tuesday. This email should highlight a few things: A brief explanation of Giving Tuesday, your fundraising goal, the organization you plan to donate to, and how much of your sales will be going toward donations. Make sure to share additional ways your subscribers can support the cause even if they don’t make a purchase on your site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Send a special thank you email to anyone who buys your course this day. You can even include a small gift to really show your appreciation.</p>

<p>Coupons are a tried-and-true way to <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-coupon-marketing-strategies-to-close-course-sales/">increase sales</a>. A coupon can be super effective <em>if</em> implemented at the right times. However, rely on a coupon too much, and customers will always come to expect one. They’ll begin to wait or delay a purchase hoping a coupon or sale pops up soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s how you can best implement coupons to increase&nbsp; sales of your online courses.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-when-to-use-coupons">When to use coupons</h2>



<p><strong>As a prelaunch strategy</strong>. Increase the earning potential for your new course by <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-create-a-pre-launch-marketing-strategy/">building interest before it launches</a>. A coupon is great to pair with a gated course, as it’s hard for customers to know what they’re getting before they buy. A coupon will incentivize hesitant folks to make the financial investment in your course and will help boost those initial sales. Keep in mind that your “early bird” sale should be your best offer. Those who bought in early may feel cheated by a better option later. Moreover, they’ll see a better offer as a sign that the course didn’t sell well and that they overpaid.</p>



<p><strong>To gain repeat customers</strong>. Loyalty goes a long way to increase sales, and coupons can help cultivate loyalty among your customer base. For instance, you can offer existing customers early access and a discount to new courses to retain their business. You can also create a loyalty system where customers unlock codes once they’ve taken a certain amount of courses.  One effective strategy is to invite your learners to share a special code with friends and coworkers who might be interested in taking the course with them. For any referral that signs on, your learner gets their own discount. It’s a great way to encourage word of mouth sharing and to passively increase sales among your target audience.</p>



<p><strong>To create a sense of urgency</strong>. If given the option to pay less, most folks will jump on an opportunity when they see it. Sales and limited discounts create a sense of scarcity. Folks will find a timer on a coupon as a reason to purchase now, giving you a quick boost in sales.  Keep in mind that the timing should be well-reasoned. Use special occasions, sales weekends and holidays, or historic slow weeks for your business to implement a timed coupon.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-practices-when-creating-coupons">Best Practices when Creating Coupons</h2>



<p>Setting up a coupon is super simple. Navigate to LEARNDASH LMS > Coupon and click on “Add New.” From there, you can customize to your liking. As you personalize, keep the following in mind:</p>



<p><strong>Give it a good name</strong>. Use a coupon name that relates to the purpose, such as “back to school sale.” A coupon should have a smart but short name to catch a potential customer’s eye. In your LearnDash settings, you can name your unique coupon in the “coupon code” field.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MEW-26nZaJkJZeVGlRWzD25FndU3Ige9L2mzN05oCdSgBL6sN4Proj83KbcgsP6VxSWH9hGuy9sMr14MadnRV1J_gJ4tLZco5V7Hht-rwdofM34c_rUETvA12eIrpCpCMcnw3dRc1IbaQEjuqXfytlFNIWuI2YKB6pEfNhHJTPElSDoY7Z9taYaMIw" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong>Choose the right discount</strong>. How much to discount an online course might seem like a difficult question, but it’s easier than it seems. Try the<a href="https://www.business2community.com/strategy/works-best-percentage-deal-money-offer-01091418#5wdKS8MwD1IwQEwc.97"> rule of 100</a>: everything below $100 should be a percentage deal, while everything above should be a money-off deal. In your LearnDash settings, you’ll chose “Flat Rate” or “Percentage,” and customize from there.</p>



<p><strong>Set an expiration date</strong>. Expiration dates offer a sense of urgency and pressure to act, as well as speed up the purchasing behaviour. Always add a time limit and make that visible during your campaign. In your LearnDash settings, this is as simple as marking your Start and End date. </p>



<p><strong>Limit usage</strong>. Create a limited number of coupons to create urgency and scarcity. Creating a variety of types gives you more control over distribution (such as different customer segments, channels, or seasonal promotions). It can also help you better monitor the effectiveness of each coupon. In your LearnDash settings, you can limit the number or redemptions, courses, or groups that a coupon can apply to. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/y4j5WHYJs7XeZfDCDsQQIiNzbqv3kP25kDp3wYQdEHI5eJyhzCx6_DZFwg0ZLlRw2PHZ4uWEsZsDtQFUD2TDr6MWKdZZSVFDGj07NFnAJ-c4GL8Qr9yEP83zPPfo_H3KJf8mi5r5vkbdGfEqRpRlilV24Y6O2LzLhCWaaXmSdAfrezxbQD25wncPeA" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 id="h-create-custom-coupons-with-learndash">Create Custom Coupons with LearnDash</h2>



<p>The best part is that with LearnDash, deciding when to offer a coupon is your decision. Online course marketplaces like<a href="https://www.learndash.com/why-you-shouldnt-use-udemy/"> Udemy</a> force course creators to have perma-sales, which limit their profits. If you use your own course site, such as one built on <a href="https://www.learndash.com/pricing-and-purchase/?gclid=CjwKCAjwp9qZBhBkEiwAsYFsb13wFZ2s67QcjRSt3XjmRosnJV63HTjpXwvkcNDIXO1BRT2jFU4HiBoCsT4QAvD_BwE">LearnDash Cloud</a>, you can turn a sale off or on and limit coupons to those who would be most incentivized to use one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you’re able to control coupons, you can use them to your advantage for quick sales boosts. Plus, you&#8217;re building your <em>own</em> brand (not Udemy’s), and you don’t need to split revenue. You own all the student data, which can be leveraged for better marketing. In other words: you are in control.</p>

<p>Prepare yourself. You are about to learn about why course-based websites may be required to have Privacy Policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alright, so maybe not the most exciting topic, but it’s an important one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Privacy is becoming a bigger and bigger deal. Consumers are expecting website owners to respect their privacy, and non-compliance fines can be quite expensive simply for failing to disclose your own privacy practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>If your course website is collecting regulated data, you have an obligation to provide specific details so your visitors understand what you’re doing with their data.</strong></p>



<p>This article (and webinar) is intended to provide course creators the basics for what website policies are, when they are required for certain course-creator websites, and what you can do to get proper policies in place (and keep them up to date over time).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before we move any further, it’s important for us to note that this article and webinar is not legal advice and is for informational purposes only. You should speak to an attorney in your area for assistance with your compliance needs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-regulated-data">What is regulated data?</h2>



<p>Things like names, email addresses, and IP addresses are being regulated under a multitude of privacy laws throughout the world.&nbsp; If you are collecting this regulated data, you may be required to have a Privacy Policy, regardless of where you are located.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is already a huge takeaway: governments that create privacy laws don’t care about where your business is located. They care about protecting their people’s data. So if you’re collecting regulated data from multiple areas, you may be required to comply with multiple privacy laws and make the disclosures required under each one (yes, each privacy law is different).</p>



<h2 id="h-is-collecting-regulated-data-bad">Is collecting regulated data bad?</h2>



<p>Not at all! You just have to make some disclosures about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collecting data like names, emails, and IP addresses helps your customers have a great experience while using your website. It also helps you make improvements to your website over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only thing that has really changed is that you need to be conscious of your privacy practices and ensure you have the respective policies on your website that contain the proper disclosures you specifically are required to make under the law(s) that apply to you.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-your-website-course-collect-regulated-data">Does your website course collect regulated data?</h2>



<p>Virtually all modern websites collect regulated data. It’s darn near a requirement to ensure spammers aren’t trying to attack your contact forms and it would be impossible to take payments otherwise.&nbsp; So collecting data is normal for websites, and it may be a lot more common than you think.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Common features for course platforms that collect regulated data:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Course and membership registrations</li><li>Accepting payments</li><li>Embedded 3rd party videos</li><li>Engagement triggers</li><li>Rewarding your Learners</li><li>Email drips</li><li>Discussion forums</li><li>LearnDash Integrity</li><li>Quizzes</li></ul>



<p><strong>Common integrations where course creators are sharing data with third parties:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Embedding 3rd party videos for courses (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)</li><li>Payment gateway integrations (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)</li><li>Automatic renewal notifications (Mailgun, ActiveCampaign, Mailchimp, etc.)</li><li>Email newsletter subscription forms (Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, Constant Contact, etc.)</li><li>Data transfer providers (Zapier, etc.)</li></ul>



<p>If you found yourself collecting and possibly even sharing data from the above examples, then <a href="https://www.learndash.com/webinar-selling-with-trust-privacy-regulated-data-for-course-creators/">our next webinar</a> is made for you!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-why-should-i-care">Why should I care?</h2>



<p>Simply put, you should have website policies to make more sales and avoid non-compliance <a href="https://termageddon.com/laws-require-privacy-policy/">fines or lawsuits</a>. In other words, by using website policies, you build trust and help comply with laws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Privacy isn’t going anywhere (if anything it’s becoming more important) and failure to provide a fully compliant Privacy Policy is what gets website owners into trouble when it comes to privacy laws (where fines start at $2,500 per website visitor whose rights you’ve infringed upon).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You should consider joining our webinar where we’ll teach you the basics of website policies, how to obtain proper ones, and how to easily keep them up to date over time!</p>



<h2 id="h-so-what-can-you-do-about-it">So what can you do about it?</h2>



<p>Do not fear website policies, rather, embrace them! Join us in <a href="https://www.learndash.com/webinar-selling-with-trust-privacy-regulated-data-for-course-creators/">our next webinar</a>, where we will share why and how course creators can get proper website policies to help them comply with laws and limit their liability.&nbsp; Build trust with prospective clients, make more sales, and limit your liability, all in one webinar!</p>

<p>If you’ve created a course, or <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-reasons-to-create-your-first-online-course/">dreamed of launching your own course series</a>, you’ve probably thought about your launch strategy. Do you imagine a huge event and a limited release? Or, are you considering an evergreen course that will always be available?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which to use? Which is best?</p>



<p>There’s a lot to consider when deciding to go evergreen or open/close on your launch strategy. We’ll break down what you need to consider for each strategy based on three factors: the marketing effort, the income potential, and the learner experience.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-marketing-effort">Marketing Effort</h2>



<p>The marketing strategy for an open/close launch requires <strong>urgency and scarcity</strong>. Scarcity can happen naturally: say there are 100 open seats in your course. This automatically creates a sense of urgency. Your marketing material can focus on acting fast or early bird deals. Keep in mind most people buy either on the first or the last day, so plan big for those two days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The launch-style approach is a good fit for folks who are comfortable with short release windows and doing a decent amount of work upfront to prepare. Also, if marketing is not your strong suit, a launch model is quick and short. Most of your effort will rely on awareness of deadline and urgency to register.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, an evergreen approach requires <strong>ongoing promotion</strong>. There’s no big pressure at any given time to drive sales and make your course feel scarce. In fact, you could step away for a few days and not fear that your entire business would fall apart. However, you’ll always be thinking of ways to make sure your course is getting in front of your audience. This may require more strategy and tactical marketing campaigns with ongoing initiatives.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-potential-income">Potential Income&nbsp;</h2>



<p>An open/close launch strategy wil provide an <strong>initial surge of money </strong>right around launch. A rush of registrations in a two week period may provide all the funding you’ll need for months. However, this requires a close eye on budgets and predictive models to ensure you’re making back what you’ve spent on the planning, execution, and marketing of the course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This launch style is can often be inconsistent or unpredictable. If you hammer your email list every other month with a new launch, for example, it could create launch fatigue and shrink your list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Evergreen courses can bring in <strong>passive income</strong> without much work. If marketed appropriately, folks can find your course at any time and enroll, as long as your course content is continually useful to your audience segment. You’ll see money coming in each month steadily, but perhaps not in lump sums like an open/close model. In an evergreen launch, there’s no feast / famine dynamic.</p>



<h2 id="h-learner-experience">Learner Experience</h2>



<p>An open/clouse launch style is often a <strong>more hands-on</strong> course. Typically, open/close launch courses run at fixed periods and may be more likely to have harder deadlines and due dates. There will likely be more of a sense of a cohort and higher levels of interaction. This can help increase student success and completion rates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Evergreen courses are typically <strong>self-paced</strong>, requiring learners to depend on their own motivation to finish. For example, if you have an employee training course that can be taken anytime, it makes perfect sense to forgo an open/close type of launch and keep the course open consistently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-decide-your-launch-strategy">How to Decide Your Launch Strategy</h2>



<p>Consider each variable: learner experience, potential earnings, and marketing effort. Your decisions in each of these categories will likely sway you in a certain direction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you can justify answers for both models, then <strong>try both!</strong> Start with an open/close launch a few times, then transition into an evergreen approach as your content continues to prove its value over time. This method allows you to sort through issues and improve your course along the way until you’re ready to go evergreen.</p>



<p>No matter which method you decide, LearnDash works well with evergreen or open/close courses. Experiment with both launch types by exploring the <a href="http://demo.learndash.com">LearnDash demo</a> both as a learner and a course creator.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you sell content or products on your WordPress site, then you know how important it is to get your online shop set up just right. Even the slightest delay or error in a check-out process can deter a potential customer. This is especially true if you’ve created a storefront on a custom-built WordPress site – your checkout experience needs to be seamless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, there’s a popular plugin in the WordPress world called <a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a> that serves as the gold standard for WordPress shops and checkout solutions. WooCommerce unlocks the ability to turn your website into an online shop, allowing you to sell products, collect payments, and let customers manage accounts.</p>



<p>If you sell courses, using WooCommerce as your storefront is one of the simplest decisions you can make, but there are a few considerations before you move ahead. Let’s explore when it makes sense to use WooCommerce.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-reasons-to-use-woocommerce-for-selling-courses">Reasons to use WooCommerce for selling courses</h3>



<p>WooCommerce has become the go-to storefront on WordPress because it offers <a href="https://woocommerce.com/features/">robust features</a>. Considering how specific features will meet your needs can help you determine if it’s the right option for selling your course. Here’s why you might want to use it:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Use any payment gateway</strong>: One of the biggest strengths of WooCommerce is the vast number of payment options available. LearnDash is already integrated with Paypal, Razorpay, and Stripe. If you’d like to use another payment gateway, there are <a href="https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/">100+ payment gateways</a> available for WooCommerce— more than any other ecommerce plugin.</p>



<p><strong>Tons of customization</strong>: WooCommerce lets you customize to your heart’s content and control the way customers experience purchasing your course. You can easily add discounts, coupons, and course bundles and packages.&nbsp;Plus, there are <em>thousands</em> of extensions available for shipping, marketing, automation, payments, social media, and anything else you can imagine. We like combining WooCommerce with <a href="https://iconicwp.com/">IconicWP</a>, which is a plugin that helps you create a fast and profitable ecommerce store without any technical knowledge.</p>



<p><strong>Sell physical goods along with courses</strong>: Since WooCommerce allows you to sell any product, you can also list physical products for sale along with your courses. For instance, you can also sell T-shirts or merchandise to not only add a passive income stream but to create a community of fans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The LearnDash WooCommerce integration is popular because it provides enormous flexibility. If you’re looking to build the ultimate custom ecommerce experience, play around with WooCommerce as you build your storefront. </p>

<h3 id="h-reasons-not-to-use-woocommerce">Reasons <em>not</em> to use WooCommerce</h3>



<p>While it is incredibly powerful, WooCommerce does come with more of a learning curve than most other plugins and integrations. You might not want to use WooCommerce for LearnDash if:</p>



<p><strong>You’re looking for a quick and easy setup</strong>: Loads of customization options can also add confusion. If you’re looking for a super simple setup to get going immediately, you might find WooCommerce slowing you down.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>You have limited courses with a small audience</strong>: One of the best perks of WooCommerce is automation. But if you prefer to manage a small learner group manually, you may find you don’t need all of WooCommerce’s extra features.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>You’re concerned about site speed</strong>: If you don’t have premium hosting and you’re worried about site speed, keep in mind that WooCommerce is a huge plugin that takes up space on a website. You could potentially face unnecessary slowdowns with all of WooCommerce’s features.</p>



<p>If you’re offering a straightforward checkout experience without extra bells and whistles, you may want to stick with a smaller, simpler ecommerce solution.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-the-best-of-both-worlds-woocommerce-with-learndash-cloud">The best of both worlds: WooCommerce with LearnDash Cloud</h3>



<p>If you’re ready to harness the power of both WooCommerce and LearnDash, you can get started one of two ways: WooCommerce works with both the LearnDash plugin as well as LearnDash Cloud.</p>



<ul><li>If you’re looking to integrate WooCommerce into your existing LearnDash site, our <a href="https://www.learndash.com/support/docs/add-ons/woocommerce/">knowledgebase</a> article walks you through how to do this.</li></ul>



<ul><li>If you’re setting up a new course site, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/learndash-cloud/">LearnDash Cloud</a> makes it easy to hit the ground running with WooCommerce. During set-up, you have the option to install WooCommerce right away as you configure your LearnDash Cloud website. This is a big perk if you already know you’d like to use a payment gateway other than Stripe upon setup. You can also rest easy knowing that your premium LearnDash Cloud hosting provides the speed you need to efficiently run WooCommerce on your site.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Ready to try out LearnDash with WooCommerce? Give the <a href="https://demo.learndash.com/courses/basic-learndash-overview/">LearnDash Demo</a> a spin to see how our plugin works from a user&#8217;s perspective. Then, sign up for your own demo website with WooCommerce pre-installed to play in a sandbox environment.</p>

<p>Before creating your first online course, you might be thinking: <em>will anyone want to buy this?</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Determining if there’s a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-tips-for-determining-if-your-online-course-has-a-market/">market for your course</a> is an important first step in the creation process. The best way to do this is to conduct market research. Market research helps you understand who might want your course and ensure there’s enough demand.</p>



<p>Market research also helps you write content specifically tailored to your audience. Because of this, it’s important to perform market research early, preferrably in the ideation stage. The more you know about your market, the more you can speak to their specific pain points. Plus, the more useful and attractive your content becomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s how to start conducting market research for your online course.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-determine-your-course-idea">Determine your course idea&nbsp;</h2>



<p>First thing, ask yourself: “is my course worth creating?” The hard truth is that your original idea may be wrong. Thankfully, you can use hard data to answer this question instead of relying on your own inner critic. Here are a few tools to help:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Check course marketplace sites. </strong>Exploring<strong> </strong>sites like <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> can help you figure out how your online course fits into the broader market. Udemy lets you browse popular topics within subjects like business, design, marketing, and more. Check to see how extensively your course subject is already offered and which topics are most popular and trending.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Perform keyword research. </strong>There are a bevy of tools available for keyword research. Sites like <a href="https://sparktoro.com/product/dashboard">Sparktoro</a> can help you search what your audience is frequently talking about online. See what results come up to make sure your course topic is not only relevant but necessary.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Stay up-to-date.</strong>&nbsp; Read industry news, blogs, and articles within your niche so that your course reflects the newest and latest within your subject field. Additionally, by staying up to date, you may find a new segment of the market who needs your online course.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2 id="h-create-a-learner-persona">Create a Learner Persona</h2>



<p>A <a href="https://www.td.org/atd-blog/how-to-develop-learner-personas-for-effective-training">learner persona</a> is a similar concept to a buyer persona. It’s a representation of a potential student who may enroll in your course. The benefit of a learner persona is to get in the mind of your learner to find out what they would need from an online course. This single persona serves to represent the target market and can help focus your guidelines for developing an effective course.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some key characteristics to fill out for your learner persona:</p>



<ul><li>Demographics (don’t forget to give your persona a name, too)&nbsp;</li><li>Their comfort level with the material (beginner, intermediate, expert, etc)&nbsp;</li><li>Their pain points and goals within your niche. For example, are they looking for self-improvement, or to build on the skills learned in your course for their own business ventures?&nbsp;</li><li>Their level of technical ability. How streamlined should your own course be for their sake?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Conceptualizing your learner as a real person can help make sure you’re talking and writing like a human, both within your course as well as your marketing material.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-send-out-a-survey">Send Out a Survey</h2>



<p>Surverys can provide some quick feedback on how likely your audience would be to take your online course. Before sending out a survey, consider first your newly-created learner persona. Can you segment your market into a smaller group that fits the description of your learner persona? Send those folks the survey first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s an idea of what you can ask users in a survey:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>If they’ve ever taken an online course&nbsp;</li><li>If they’ve taken a course, if the content was useful&nbsp;</li><li>How much they paid or would be willing to pay for an online course</li><li>If you offered a course on a chosen topic, would they take it?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>LearnDash integrates with SurveyMonkey for an automated process with a variety of trigger settings. For example, if a user enrolls in a course (even a free sample course), you can set up an automation to email your new learner with a survey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, you can always create a generic survey before getting into LearnDash by using <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/">SurveyMonkey</a> or your favorite survey tool, such as <a href="https://workspace.google.com/products/forms/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=na-US-all-en-dr-bkws-all-all-trial-e-dr-1011401&amp;utm_content=text-ad-none-any-DEV_c-CRE_595123210492-ADGP_Desk%20%7C%20BKWS%20-%20EXA%20%7C%20Txt%20~%20Forms_Google%20Forms-KWID_43700063921124670-kwd-299031573119&amp;utm_term=KW_google%20forms%20survey-ST_google%20forms%20survey&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwsMGYBhAEEiwAGUXJaXgx4FPpy2hwcKmcjpDbhMeUXBxGute_xhyEsQHUWwcCBkMX0iorrRoC24sQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Google Forms</a>. You can even send out tailored buyer persona surveys using templates via tools like <a href="https://survicate.com/survey-templates/buyer-persona-survey/">Survicate</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-check-out-the-competition">Check Out the Competition</h2>



<p>Once you’ve done some research on the marketplace and your audience, you’ll want to narrow your scope and look directly at your competitors. Start by making a list of who your course competes with for attention. Then, write down how they describe their course. Finally, compare&nbsp; your course idea and see what makes yours unique. The more you stand out from the crowd, you more you may pique learner’s interest.</p>



<p>Another helpful tool can be to perform a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swot.asp">SWOT analysis</a> of competitors. A SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Growth) is a tried and true business strategy for planning and execution. You’ve likely already done this for your own course and brand, but have you considered your competitors from a SWOT analysis standpoint? You may learn that an area of weakness from your competitors is a potential opportunity for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-create-an-action-plan">Create an Action Plan</h2>



<p>With the knowledge gleaned from examining the market, creating a learner persona and a survey, and analyzing the competition, you can form an action plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In your action plan, identify:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Your overall goal for the course</li><li>Your next steps&nbsp;</li><li>Your priorities organized by importance&nbsp;</li><li>Solutions to any problems you’ve identified</li><li>Due dates for deliverables (and your course going live!)&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Remember, no amount of market research will give you a perfect answer as to whether your online course will be successful. However, conducting market research will help you determine if your course has a chance. In the end, you still need to execute properly if you want to start and grow an online course business.</p>

<p>What you call your course matters. After all, not only does your course name indicate the subject matter but like any good book, titles entice the user to learn more.</p>



<p>As you know, online audiences have short attention spans and often make snap decisions based on a quick first impression. Most folks only stay on a web page for about 15 seconds, so if the name of your course doesn’t grab their attention, they may click elsewhere for content that seems more worth their time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help you think more critically about what to call your class, we’ve gathered six reasons why we think it’s important to have this conversation about your course name.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-your-course-appears-more-professional-when-branded">Your course appears more professional when branded</h3>



<p>If you’ve named courses before, bring the title to mind: how does the name reflect on your brand? Does the phrasing, wording, imaging, and banners all show the learner what your company is about? Everyone should think of how their course reflects on their brand. By using language you would use to describe your overall company aesthetic, you’re ensuring that your course is an extension of what you offer as a whole.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-a-good-course-name-allows-for-specific-design-elements">A good course name allows for specific design elements&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The more specific and focused your course name is, the more you can use it as a design framework. For example, instead of offering an “introduction to photography” course, your customers can say they enrolled in a “photography bootcamp” or “photography academy.” That sort of branding unlocks tons of potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a bootcamp, for example, you can refer to lesson elements as “stations” where learners stop and practice a new skill. Learners can run “drills” (quizzes) to test their knowledge. With a focused, tailored title, it unlocks more potential for creative, unified, and specific course design.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-seo-best-practices-can-attract-more-users">SEO best practices can attract more users&nbsp;</h3>



<p>If you hope to grow traffic to your courses organically, you should be following <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-tips-to-build-seo-strength-for-your-online-course/">SEO (search engine optimization) best practices</a>. We have some specific tips for course creation SEO from <a href="https://www.learndash.com/using-seo-to-sell-more-online-courses/">Rebecca Gill that can help you sell your courses</a>. Tools like <a href="https://ahrefs.com/">Ahrefs</a> help you find phrases, keywords, and search terms for a course name, along with how difficult it would be to rank each option.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also run potential name ideas through <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=CA">Google Trends</a>. This free service can help you identify search volume patterns as well as related search queries and topics. For example, if you search “how to vlog” in Google Trends, you’ll see the related topics are “YouTube” and “TikTok.” So, if you tailored a class especially for “how to vlog on TikTok,” you may hit a niche market where more folks will be interested in your course!&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-it-sets-you-apart-from-competitors">It sets you apart from competitors&nbsp;</h3>



<p>This is one of the most important ideas behind why it’s important to think about your course title. Potential learners need to see right in the title that what you offer differs from your competitors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s think back to the photography bootcamp example. If your course fully embraces this concept of a “bootcamp” then over time, your course may be known among competitors as an intensive crash course on the subject. Other interested folks will start to recognize that your course design is different than any other basic course model and will gravitate towards your course as having a perceived benefit over the competition. All of this begins with a name!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-a-course-name-has-to-mean-something">A course name has to &#8220;mean&#8221; something</h3>



<p>One big mistake in naming courses is falling into the trap of being too cute or clever. Puns, acronyms, and other turns of phrases are fun and exciting to brainstorm, but at the end of the day, they are often empty cliches that don’t mean much. Relying too much on a pun can even mislead potential learners or turn them off. Clarity should beat cleverness every time.</p>



<h3 id="h-it-sets-expectations-for-the-learners">It sets expectations for the learners&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Similar to specificity for SEO purposes, specificity in your name should also address pain points your course is going to solve. One way to think about this is to answer the question:&nbsp; “What is the value of my course?” Most often, this goes back to learning outcomes, which are the objectives you want your learners to take away from the course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s think back to the vlogging example. “How to vlog,” doesn’t quite mean anything. “How to vlog on TikTok” is better, but what are learners really taking away? “From Beginner to Pro: How to vlog on TikTok” explains a bit more the value of your course.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What folks are buying is a <em>transformation</em>. A great course name should set the expectation for how much work is ahead of them while also hinting at the benefits. How will your course make their lives better?&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>With these considerations in mind, we hope you agree that it’s important to think deeply about what goes into your next course name. No matter how great your content, if the name doesn’t hint or showcase this, you might never entice folks enough to check it out.</p>

<p>If you plan to <a href="https://www.learndash.com/5-course-pricing-models-explained/">charge a premium for your course</a>, you must ensure the experience lives up to the price tag. That could mean offering a little something extra to help students justify the cost.</p>



<p>At a minimum, your course should provide top-notch content and a <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-organize-your-online-course-content/">seamless student interface</a>. But you can also include a few extras to incentivize learners to sign up for your course. Here are five options to consider if you’re looking for ways to justify a higher course price and sweeten the deal for students.</p>



<h2>1. Share downloadable bonus content.</h2>



<p>People love a useful freebie. Templates, spreadsheets, worksheets, and other <a href="https://elearningindustry.com/ideas-to-use-pdf-in-elearning">downloadable goodies</a> provide value by helping students jump-start a project or apply course lessons to their specific needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The type of freebie you offer will depend on your <a href="https://www.learndash.com/how-to-choose-a-topic-for-your-course-in-a-saturated-market/">course topic</a>. For example, if your course is about personal finance, you might give away a convenient budgeting spreadsheet to students who enroll.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>2. Recruit a well-known instructor.</h2>



<p>You don’t need an A-list celebrity as the face of your course, but it helps to have a recognizable and reputable instructor. Prospective students will be more willing to pay a higher price if they’re confident in the teacher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make sure you—or whoever is teaching your course—is respected in your field and has relevant credentials. Highlight those credentials in your course description and emphasize your street cred wherever it’s relevant.</p>



<h2>3. Offer one-on-one coaching.</h2>



<p>Sometimes, online learning can feel a little impersonal—especially if students don’t receive individual attention from the instructor. Add a personal and premium touch to your course by offering one-on-one coaching to each student who signs up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might offer a 30-minute phone session with each student, for example, or you could offer in-depth, personalized feedback on one of the course assignments.</p>



<h2>4. Create a community.</h2>



<p>For some learners, <a href="https://www.learndash.com/creating-a-robust-social-community-within-your-lms/">connecting with other students</a> is just as valuable as a qualified instructor and one-on-one coaching. Make it easy for learners to network with each other by providing a private community just for class participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can use an add-on like <a href="https://www.learndash.com/add-on/restrict-content-pro/">Restrict Content Pro</a> to keep this community in a gated section of your website. You can also opt for a platform like Google Groups or Facebook Groups if that’s where your students prefer to interact.</p>



<h2>5. Provide certification.</h2>



<p>You can justify charging a little more for your course if it offers a worthwhile certification. This may require some extra work on your end to coordinate with the governing body or association for your industry, but it can be worth the extra effort to provide this added value to your learners—and give your course’s credibility a boost.</p>



<h2 id="h-justify-a-higher-course-price-with-learndash">Justify a higher course price with LearnDash.</h2>



<p>If you’re ready to create a high-ticket course, the capability of your course platform must also match the price. LearnDash was created by educators for course creators. That means we understand all the tools your students need to succeed, which include advanced quizzing to gauge learning retention, focus mode for distraction-free learning, leaderboards for gamification, and more!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://paprikaads.com/9-types-of-emails-your-subscribers-actually-want-receive/">Paprika ads</a>.</p>



<p>The first step to organizing and promoting your online course with email marketing is to <a href="https://www.learndash.com/7-email-list-building-strategies-for-course-creators/">build an email list</a>.</p>



<p>On this list, you’ll add the customer&#8217;s email addresses to whom you want to sell your online course. Once you’ve done it, you can send a mass email to your contacts and get them to enroll in your training program.</p>



<p>How can you build your email list fast and from scratch? Follow these tips and upgrade your list-building strategy:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Collect emails ethically and effectively — </strong>one thing you don’t want to do when building an email list is to be intrusive. Use embedded signup forms on your website to gather visitors’ data or build a strong customer referral program.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Collect the data you need — </strong>think about what kind of information you need from your customers. Design sign-up forms accordingly and keep them short. Ask people to fill in 1-3 fields to avoid form abandonment.</li></ul>
