Persistent Login keeps users logged into your website securely, unless they explicitly log out. Also limit the number of active logins users are allowed to have at one time.

== Description ==

Persistent Login is a simple plugin that keeps users logged into your website unless they explicitly choose to log-out. 

You can also limit the number of active login sessions your users are allowed to have at one time.

It requires no set-up, just install and save your users time by keeping them logged into your website securely, avoiding the annoyance of forgetting usernames & passwords.

For added security, users can visit their Profile page in the WP Admin area to see how many sessions they have, what device was used and when they were last active. The user can choose to end any session with the click of a button.

## Persistent Login Features
* Selects the 'Remember Me' box by default. 
  * If left checked, users will be kept logged in for 1 year
* Each time a user revisits your website, their login is extended to 1 year again
* Dashboard stats show you how many users are being kept logged in
* Force log-out all users with the click of a button
* Users can manage their active sessions from the Profile page in the admin area
* Support for common plugins out of the box
* Secure, fast and simple to use!

## NEW: Active Logins
* Option to limit the number of active logins to 1 per user
* New logins can be blocked, or the users oldest login ended automatically.

### Top Tip
Once the plugin is installed, click the **End all Sessions** button on the plugin settings page to encourage users to login again and be kept logged in forever!

### Supported Plugins
* PeepSo
* Theme My Login
* Ultimate Member
* Ultimate Member - Terms and Conditions Extension

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How long will it keep users logged in? =

If a user visits your website more than once a year, they will be kept logged in forever. 

The only way for them to be logged out is if they clear their cookies, click logout, or don't return within 1 year. 

= What is an active login? =

Sometimes called concurrent logins, this is the number of devices or browsers one user is logged into. If you limit the number of active logins, users can only be logged into your website once. 

If a user logs in to a second device, the first device will automatically be logged out.

= The Remember Me box isn't checked =

If the Remember Me box on a login form isn't checked by default, please open a support request on the Plugin Directory. 

It is most likely a conflict with another plugin or theme, which can usually be fixed. 

= Can I hide the Remember Me box? =

On the free version, no. You can write your own CSS or JavaScript to remove the Remember Me box from a page if you'd like. You will need FTP access to achieve this.

The premium version has a simple setting to hide the Remember Me box by default, and it also works with supported plugins like Theme My Login!

= I don't stay logged in on multiple devices =

If you're not being kept logged in on multiple devices, try turning on 'Allow duplicate sessions' from the settings page. 

This is most common if you're trying to login to two machines with the same operating system and browser on the same network.

= Can I limit the number of logins each user is allowed? Like Netflix? =

Yes, you can now control **active logins** with WordPress Persistent Login. Just visit the Active Logins tab on the settings page and enable active logins. 

The premium version allows you to customise the number of active logins, which user roles they apply to and whether users can select which logins they end when they reach the limit. 

= Is it compatible with WordPress Multisite =

No. WordPress Persistent login isn't compatible with multisite installations at the moment.

= Is it secure? =

You bet! 

WP Persistent Login uses core WordPress methods to ensure that we're logging in the right user. 

= Support =

Support for a bug can be requested from the WordPress Plugin Directory. Premium users can request support directly from the WP Admin area.


= Is it free? =

Yes. The free forever version is and always will be free. All of your users will be kept logged-in when they revisit your website.

* Manage which user roles have persistent login and active login limits
* Set how long users are kept logged in for (up to 1 year)
