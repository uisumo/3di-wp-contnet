2017-03-29,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Marks,Le'Sean,Coach,Phoenix,AZ,I would recommend this course to other coaches because it's a good tool to for ideas of better interaction with the athletes we coach. Dimensions 2 and 3 within the course was most valuable. Learning how to effectively and efficiently impact the lives of the athletes that I coach and building life long relationships.
2017-03-05,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Fakkema,Chad,Coach,Lynden,WA,"Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course! This is a great base for coaches to be a better coach. As I watched, I took notes that will be used to help teach other coaches."
2017-02-17,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Ford,Jason,Coach,Gilbert,AZ,"The overall theme of moving your coaching style from that of fear based towards that which is rooted in love, yet yields even greater results. I would recommend this to coaches because it has invaluable information on how to take a whole new perspective on the way in which we coach."
2017-02-17,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Hallock,John,Coach,Richmond,KY,"Yes, I would recommend this course to other coaches. I found the emphasis on the 3 dimensions of coaching valuable. It gave me language for something I knew intuitively."
2017-02-06,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Hobson,Melissa,Coach,Peoria,AZ,3D coaching has been a game changer for me and direction I have taken my program. Coaching the heart of the athlete has greater results than just coaching the skill and drill.
2017-01-29,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Crowe,Roger,Coach,Wellford,SC,I have been recommending to everyone I come into contact with. I really like the length of the sessions. I've worked through them at my own pace and I have been able to work on them at little as time. I've greatly enjoyed ALL of the material and look forward to using more and more of this material in my own coaching AND parenting. Thank you!
2017-01-27,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Davis,Matthew,Coach,Rockville,MO,This course makes you really look at what you are doing in your program and what you need to change. I would recommend this course to other coaches. Make sure that you are not in season when you start because it is a large time commitment but well worth it.
2017-01-25,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Boyer,Cait,Coach,Omaha,NE,I recommend this course because it is a great chance to look at how you are doing things and how you could do things differently.
2017-01-16,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Murray,Scott,Coach,Livonia,MI,"I recommend this course because I feel that we can continue to improve ourselves to make ourselves better.  All coaches should strive for this goal. All of the content was solid, however, how sport relates to our faith was the most inspiring to me."
2017-01-06,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Magness,John,Coach,Elgin,OK,"I got so many valuable things out of this course, there are too many to list."
2017-01-03,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Bernhardt,Jeff,Coach,Coal Valley,IL,This course should be seen by every coach and made as a resource for those in clubs coaching youth sports. It provided me what I was missing and helped me highlight what I was doing.
2017-01-03,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Cochran,Matt,Coach,Butler,MO,I recommend this course because it is very intuitive as far as keeping the cohesiveness of a team together. Keeping the idea of the kids first - more important than winning a game.
2016-12-21,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Hamilton,Jody,Coach,Nicholasville,KY,I recommend this course because it gives great insight to helping young people understand the true meaning of life. The transformational purpose statement sesction was the most valuable part of this course to me.
2016-12-11,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Beckwith,Merlinn,Coach,Grand Junction,CO,"Before I took this course I didn't know my purpose as a coach and I was always striving for more and looking for jobs higher up (collegiate level) because it made sense to move up the ladder. After taking this course it helped me realize I am good at coaching the youth level because the Lord has given me a story to tell, the knowledge to teach, and the passion to make a difference in the lives of young athletes. Youth players need coaches to tell them that they are fearfully and wonderfully made to make an impact in this world. And that sport is not what defines these players it is their character and whom they choose to become. I recommend this course to other coaches because I know this way of coaching makes a difference in the lives of players, coaches, parents, and the sport community."
2016-12-10,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Buss,BJ,Coach,Appleton,WI,I already have began recommending this course to other coaches. It helps coaches be more fulfilled in coaching by truly understanding what matters.
2016-12-06,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Hutchens,Jason,Coach,Gilbert,AZ,"This course was a reminder of why I started coaching in the first place. I started coaching at the youth level with 6-8 year olds and have moved up the ranks to high school. I started with the youth because of the poor behavior I witnessed from other coaches and I thought to myself, I have to get involved and teach the kids to love football not grow to hate it. These principles of 3D coaching have reminded me that I began my journey for the right reasons and I need to work harder to continue to coach the same way regardless of what level I am coaching. I think too many kids lose their love of sports because of bad coaches. I don't believe the coaches intend coach in such a way as to lose their athletes, it's just what they know. It is probably how they were coached many years ago. This course could redirect their passion for their game and the kids in a positive manner."
2016-11-15,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Henry,Tyler,Coach,Fair Grove,MO,I would recommend this coursehelps coaches understand what the real goals for coaching should be. To further evaluate my purpose in coaching was the most valuable part.
2016-10-28,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Chriest,Cassidy,Coach,Peoria,AZ,"I would absolutely recommend this course. I feel different and made new now in an incredible way. The person that I am naturally has both the 1st and 3rd dimension mind. Learning about the 2nd dimension and how important team cohesion, emotions, confidence and motivation are truly made me feel like an entirely new coach."
2016-10-25,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Lame,Lesli,Coach,Adrian,MO,"I would absolutely recommend this course. This course can help even the most seasoned coaches become better at inspiring their athletes. These strategies I will use throughout the year as I coach. I will no longer coach 'JUST during my season, I will now continue to be a coach/leader to my athletes throughout their lives."
2016-10-20,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Weeks,Scotty,Coach,Maurice,LA,"For years I always thought there was something missing, but never acted on it. I figured that was the way it was. Now to realize that there is an intentional process, is a game changer in all my coaching. Not just sports. I would especially recommend this course at the community level. Volunteer Coaches are more so in need of this information. Professional coaches have some access to formal training. Volunteer coaches fly by the seat of their pants and and are the ones that set the framework before the players get to HS."
2016-10-12,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Bronson,Justin,Coach,Santa Maria,CA,This course was very beneficial to help me reflect on my role as a coach. The strategies/activities to use to coach in 2nd and 3rd dimension were the most valuable part to me.
2016-09-28,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Spickler,Tim,Coach,Winnebago,IL,This course is life-changing. Something I have been searching for a long time. Writing my transformational purpose statement was the most meaningful part to me.
2016-09-08,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Bennett,Wes,Coach,Robards,KY,This course opened my mind to ideas that I had previously not considered and the course content was excellent. The material was well presented. I have already begun to share this with other coaches.
2016-09-06,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Boughton,Patrick,Coach,Altoona,WI,I would recommend this course to coaches because I think it would be helpful for all coaches to see a different perspective.
2016-08-28,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Thatcher,Sheila,Coach,Idaho Falls,ID,I absolutely recommend this course!!! Sports is more than winning - it is about relationships and building Godly character!!!
2016-08-23,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Anthony,James,Coach,Cleveland,TN,"This course gives you an understanding of each dimension and how to connect my players to each. I'd recommend it, it really helps you fabricate a framework for how you coach."
2016-08-23,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Lee,Johnny,Coach,Vernon,WA,I recommend it to other coaches. It forces you to think why you do (or do not do) what you do. Learning the dynamics of each dimension was very valuable.
2016-08-19,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Wichers,Shane,Coach,Everson,WA,I would recommend this course. It makes you think and challenges your coaching. It made me re-calibrate myself so I'm not just focused on winning.
2016-08-17,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Van Dyken,Erika,Coach,Nooksack,WA,"The breakdown of the second dimension was the most valuable part to me. I feel it gave some great examples that I can use with my own athletes to help build them as players. The athletes we coach, as well as the society we coach in, are always changing and I feel this course has incredible insight on how we coach the change."
2016-08-17,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Wing,Clay,Coach,Sedro-Woolley,WA,It was reaffirming that I'm on the right track with my coaching. I'd recommend this course to other coaches. It's practical.
2016-08-15,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Christiansen,Eric,Coach,Yorktown,VA,"I would, have, and will be continually recommending this course. Every coach should take this course because it helps to organize so many thoughts and strategies so that they can be implemented effectively. The most valuable things to me were: The ability to articulate and implement many 2nd and 3rd dimension strategies. The research to help recognize the great power and responsibility that being a coach brings. 'You can't be a tour guide to a land you haven't visited'."
2016-08-14,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Akers,Kathy,Coach,Bellingham,WA,"I know coaches that are stuck in the first dimension, and don't understand why their kids lose games. It's so much more than skills on the pitch. It's caring for the girls before and after practice. I love the God principles and how they link to what I considered coaching 101."
2016-08-12,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Kaeming,Dan,Coach,Lynden,WA,"This course affirmed me as to what we have been doing and gave me new techniques going forward. I definitely recommend it, itgets you in the mindset of 'why' we do what we do."
2016-08-10,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Wright,Adam,Coach,Marshfield,MO,This course reminded me that there is much more to coaching than the physical aspect. I would recommend this course because it is easy for coaches to get caught up in a win at all cost attitude.
2016-08-08,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Hartloge,Brittany,Coach,Ballwin,MO,"This course reinforced what I was already doing for my team. It gave me great ideas and new strategies that I hadn't used before. It gave me a renewed sense of power and strength. I was overcome with emotion watching good coaches inspire their players. That is who I want to be as a coach. That is how I want my players to see me. I would absolutely recommend this course to other coaches. It will completely change the way they view their team, players, parents, and themselves."
2016-08-06,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Gonzales,Bryan,Coach,Santa Fe,NM,Every coach should watch this to break the mold of old school coaching. It was valuable to learn about how to properly treat players and the use of positive feedback.
2016-08-05,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Ragsdale,Michael,Coach,Marshfield,MO,I really enjoyed seeing some strategies that would help in being a more all around coach.  I believe with the way the coaching world is now that all coaches are going to have to transition into more of a 3D coaching style. The old school days of yelling and running are done.
2016-08-04,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Ohelo,Chad,Coach,Yelm,WA,"I hate to sound so cliche but I found value in the entire course.  I found most value in a few things. First, building the purpose statement was a must for me; I liked the teaching content to get me there. Secondly, I chose the Plus+ certification because the material is out of my comfort zone; I learned greatly from it. Finally, I find great value in the parental video in the end.  This will help me align myself with the parents, who are (at least I believe) an important part of a program moving forward.  The video will help me articulate 3D coaching because this program is exact opposite of how most coaches in my area operate.  I absolutely would recommend this course because of the content within it. The content in this course is not only valuable for coaches, but also for teachers, staff, or any other field that works with young people.  I had highly suggested this course to my previous administrators for school wide Professional Development, but of course it was a no go because it wasn't their idea."
2016-08-03,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Petke,Dan,Coach,Bridgeton,MO,"The strategies to implement 2nd and 3rd dimension coaching were helpful. I also very much enjoyed the discussions with Jane Albright following the 301 videos. I would recommend this course. Though most of the coaches I know are striving for these things, this program provides them with tangible strategies to elevate your coaching to that level."
2016-07-31,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Sovers,Mark,Coach,Solon,IA,The ability to reflect on my coaching philosophy from the 'inside-out' was the most valuable part of this course. I would recommend it because I believe it is a great way to examine the true lessons of sport and how they relate to success on and off the playing field. Coaches will be given the opportunity to truly have an impact with their athletes and truly go on a difference making journey of self and others.
2016-07-25,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Powell,Grey,Athletic Director,Edmond,OK,"The entire course was great! The sections 201 & 301 were incredibly helpful in packaging thoughts, ideas & practices that I have been doing and assigning & aligning them with our purpose. As an AD I will be asking my coaches to take this course. It is impactful and transformative. Very clear and concise while being complex and groundbreaking."
2016-07-22,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,VanDalen,Blake,Coach,Lynden,WA,I would definitely recommend this course to other coaches. 100%. The 2nd dimension information was very useful and the 3rd dimension information could potentially chang my life if I begin to apply it.
2016-07-13,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Coleman,Bob,Coach,Poplar,WI,"The biggest thing that got me excited was the connection between good and great.  I also enjoyed how everything was connected and supported by research. I would recommend this to other coaches because it is well structured and taught very well. The instructors made connects of the different topics, the research and real life."
2016-07-07,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Searson,Thomas,Coach,Marshfield,MO,"This course helped to put things in perspective.  The issued discussed were things that I think almost all coaches think of but this brought its proper priority. I would recommend this course, it would help any coach.  I wish I had this course when I first started coaching."
2016-06-21,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,3,Barker,Elizabeth,Coach,Ballwin,MO,It was valuable learning how important it is to coach not only the skill of the sport as well as coach the player as a whole looking at the player's heart and life that they are living.
2016-06-18,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Deignan,Jim,Coach,Eau Claire,WI,"Connecting learned leadership principles in the work setting to sport in a structured way through the 3 dimensions. Im very appreciative of this as it reaffirms where I believe God has been pointing me towards in my personal and professional life. I most definitely recommend this course to other coaches, and already have!"
2016-06-13,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Salkeld,Dave,Coach,Bow,WA,"The most valuable part of this course was learning strategies for motivating young athletes and  letting them know they are worthy young adults as well as our athletes. Many coaches already utilize, or have used , many ideas you provide.  Many do not, however.  This may open or reopen their eyes."
2016-06-09,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Richardson,Tommy,Coach,Zionsville,IN,It was valuable to learn about the value of the 3rd dimension involved in coaching. This course can be a valuable asset to any coach.
2016-06-06,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Johnson,Kyle,Coach,Eau Claire,WI,I would recommend this course for any coach at any level. It really shows you how and why coaches must coach at all three levels. It was valuable to realize the importance of the relationship between player and coach must be more and deeper than wins/losses and performance on the field or court.
2016-06-06,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Olson,Corey,Coach,Lake Zurich,IL,The practical application of how to become a transformational coach made this course very valuable. I believe it should be required for all new coaches.
2016-05-31,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Buran,Jessica,Coach,Iron River,WI,"I would recommend this course to coaches and teachers.  It has helped me think of the impact I have on students and athletes and has made me a better coach/teacher by being more self aware. Understanding the importance of patience, joy, love, and encouragement."
2016-05-31,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Laughrun,Linda,Coach,West Des Moines,IA,"Yes, I would recommend this course to other coaches! I think it helps coaches focus on the bigger picture, beyond the game and competition. It was valuable to learn about treating athletes as whole people and working to develop all aspects of them as a whole person."
2016-05-27,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Ward,Glenda,Coach,Broken Bow,NE,The most valuable part of taking this course was writing my transformational purpose statement. I would recommend it as there is a lot of great information throughout the course that made me think through how I work with students.
2016-05-24,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Wilmington,Christopher,Coach,St. Petersburg,FL,"This course reaffirmed to me that the most important thing about coaching is not the physical. We can be just as productive, if not more by being nurturing and loving. It will dispel the myth that coaches have to be tough, loud, in-your-face to be productive.  I'm 47 years old, I had a college coach that coached me this way. So, I have dedicated my life to being a godly coach. And this course will help me to continue to be that person and encourage others as well."
2016-05-23,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Lundquist,Marc,Coach,Eau Claire,WI,I would recommend this course to other coaches because the other two dimensions are needed. The most valuable part of this course was Writing my Tranformational Purpose Statement.
2016-05-23,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Naasz,Nate,Coach,Lincoln,KS,I would absolutely recommend this course to other coaches. This is the biggest shortcoming that coaches in America have. We need coaches to learn that sports are a tool that we use to create high quality individuals. The most valuable part of this course was Writing my Tranformational Purpose Statement.
2016-05-17,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Szydlik,Brian,Coach,Crofton,MD,"This course was full of depth and breadth.  It was detailed and full of illustrations that I can use now with my players and with my own boys.  This course is right on target and should be taken to every corner of every school district in the country for mandatory professional development for coaches. We must all be intentional and deliberate to ensure we get the best out of God's children as we shepherd them north through their own trials and ensure they serve each other, get the best out of each other while learning how to persevere through challenges that are part of sport! And through this process, we learn to find joy in the challenges and the journey!"
2016-05-13,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Brooks,Jennifer,Athletic Director,St. Louis,MO,This course reaffirms what I believe in. I would absolutely recommend this course. People need to understand that the focus needs to not be on winning - that there is so much more to the experience.
2016-05-07,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Murillo,Matt,Coach,West Des Moines,IA,This course really made me think about why I coach and what I want my players to get out of their high school experience that goes beyond winning and losing. It is always good to do a thorough self-examination of your own motivation and goals in order to better be able to coach your players. I would recommend this course.
2016-05-05,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Amys,Tanya,Coach,Maple,WI,"I am excited about putting this into practice! The most valuable thing I got out of this course is the impact that a coach can have on an athlete. I want to make sure that I am leaving a positive and lasting impact on their character. This course will change your outlook on the purpose of sport. I found it so helpful in actually developing strategies to reach students in the 2nd and 3rd dimensions, and not just saying, 'Yes, I would like to have a lasting impact on my athletes.' Now, I have strategies to make an impact and address each issue within the same dimension that the issue is taking place."
2016-05-04,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Sands,Brent,Coach,Cedar Rapids,IA,The most valuable part of this course was that it gave me an opportunity to reflect on my purpose for coaching and to align my actions with that purpose. I believe many coaches can benefit from looking within their programs and selves to define what they can do to truly make a difference in the lives of their athletes.  The more coaches with this common vision will allow for all of us to be more successful.
2016-04-20,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Brown,Chuck,Coach,Prosper,TX,Learning about the depth of a 3rd Dimension coach was most valuable to  me. I think I hit the 1st and 2nd really well and touch on the 3rd but didn't realize how deep it was. I would recommend this course to other coaches because I think it gives experienced coaches knowledge that we didn't have.  It is good for a young coach to know where to go next beyond just the techniques.
2016-04-17,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Cox,Tyler,Coach,Camden,AR,The most valuable thing I got from the course is the actual examples of different strategies to coach all 3 dimensions. I wish every coach in America could see this course.
2016-04-17,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Wiskus,Mary Beth,Coach,West Des Moines,IA,This course was an opportunity to get better! I got a couple new ideas of how to be a better coach. I also enjoyed the time to reflect on how and why I coach.
2016-04-03,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Kehr,Kent,Coach,Chesterfield,MO,The purpose statement and examples of transformational coaching were the most valuable part of this course to me. It helps for a formalized coaching strategy.
2016-04-03,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Tow Arnett,Jessica ,Coach,Prior Lake,MN,I would absolutely recommend this course. I want all the coached that coach in my program to have this certification and I will find a way to pay for it for them. I loved the strategies to implement the 3Dimensional Coaching after. You not only explained WHY it is important to be a 3D coach you showed us HOW to become one:-)!
2016-03-30,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,McKinney,William,Coach,Austin,TX,Learning to distinguish between your life purpose and your goals was the most valuable part of this course for me. I would recommend it to other coaches because coaches need educationon how to run programs not based on short-term and winning results.
2016-03-28,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Storts,Loran,Coach,Clive,IA,"Coaches coach, but who coaches coaches? I took away 20 'nuggets' that will help me coach more effectively. I will highly recommend to others. All of my assistant coaches will go through this course. I think all coaches should go through this program."
2016-03-27,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Olejniczak,Lon,Coach,Robins,IA,The self-reflection of my own coaching style and approach and the creation of my transformational purpose was the most valuable part of this course for me. I would recommend this course to other coaches. I believe if you are truly green and growing you need to learn and challenge the way you coach.  This course does that.
2016-03-23,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Muehleisen,Tim,Coach,Ballwin,MO,"The affirmation that I am doing some creative things well, and empowerment to continue to try creative 2nd and 3rd dimension things was valuable. I would recommend this course to other coaches only if they are coaches who have shown that they want to find different models for coaching. If a coach isn't ready to hear this, it will not work. If they are ready to have purpose in their work, this course could open it up for them."
2016-03-15,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Hanson,Frankie,Coach,Johnston,IA,The 2D & 3D coaching strategies and framework to be able to make it happen was the most valuable part of this course. I would totally recommend this course. It helps frame your purpose as a coach and why you are in the profession. It's a lesson for the teacher and provides a chance to self reflect and evaluate how you are doing in your job. It creates an opportunity for self-assessment and self-awareness.
2016-03-11,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Weltzin,Shawn,Coach,Alabaster,AL,"I would recommend everything about this course. On a scale of 1-10, it is a 10."
2016-02-29,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Moore,Dennis,Coach,Haslett,MI,The psychology of working with student-athletes. I needed the instruction and ideas on how to deal with the heart of student-athletes was very valuable. The course was comprehensive and extremely helpful.

2016-01-29,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Daffer,Jason,Coach,Broken Bow,NE,Information on the second dimension was the most valuable thing I got out of taking this course. I would recommend it to other coaches to get a better understanding of how to coach the athlete as a whole.
2016-01-22,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Gruhn,Matthew,Coach,Gainesville,GA,I would absolutely recommend this course. The sports world seems to be getting more corrupted each year and we need to fight back. This gives us some tools to do that with. I believe that this is a better way and that it can work.
2016-01-19,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Lomax,Neil,Coach,Tualatin,OR,It reminds and reinstates to me that I need to share this3D philosophy to as many coaches and Ads that are in my 'sphere of influence.' I would recommend this to other coaches because - it's not that they are doing 'coaching' wrong-  they just don't know how to do it right!!They need to be educated on the '3D' right way to coach
2016-01-15,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Bodenhausen,Erich,Coach,Savannah,MO,"I learned strategies to get my players to buy into the program & me as a coach.  What they learn in sports is more than wins & losses, they will fade away & be forgotten but how I treat players & what they learn about character, lasts forever. I would recommend this course to other coaches because I think coaches will get more out of kids using this & it will make our world a better place."
2016-01-15,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Cushman,Colin,Athletic Director,Bellingham,WA,Lessons in the 2nd Dimension with Dr. Jeff Duke were the most valuable.  There were many things to think about on how to get kids best effort and change attitudes.  We need to stop blaming parents and kids for the issues and change our methodology. I would absolutely recommend this to coaches. So many great things to think about.  This is a great opportunity to evaluate our philosophy as coaches and to rethink our purpose.
2016-01-12,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Schoenberg,Greg,Coach,Creve Coeur,MO,I am a new coach so this helped me learn about the way that I coach.  I plan to use the models that I saw in this course in my own coaching. It is a good course for those just getting into coaching.  It is also a good course for you to reevaluate why and how you coach.
2015-12-19,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Smith,Warren,Coach,Ballwin,MO,The discussion on 'good' and 'great' and the relationship between the two was very valuable. The discussion between the essence of a program and the qualities/characteristics of a program were very helpful and will prove to stimulate continued thinking in this area down the road...
2015-12-10,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Dunbar,Stanley,Coach,Johnston,RI,The most valuable thing I got out of this course was gaining a deeper understanding of the 2nd and 3rd dimensions of coaching and strategies to connect with players on a deeper level. I would definitely recommend this course because a coach is one of the most influential positions in society and we have to always be learning how we can leave a positive influence on our athletes and not a negative one.
2015-12-07,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Brown,Pedro,Coach,Reedsburg,WI,"I would absolutely recommend this course to other coaches!!!! I have already. mentioned it tonight after practice to the other coaches. The reinforcement and given the understanding why my coaching practices worked, I was coaching in the 2nd dimensions and scratching the 3rd. Now I have a better understanding of the hows and whys. GREAT STUFF!!!!"
2015-12-02,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Jetton,James,Coach,Niceville,FL,"This course feeds and speaks directly into what is most important for our coaches to understand.  The kids are the most important thing, we must learn how to reach, train, coach, lead, and mentor these young athletes in a way that will last a lifetime and not for a season that will end. The tools and strategies on how to implement 2nd and 3rd dimension strategies was the most valuable thing I got out of taking this course."
2015-11-19,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Bradley,Steven,Coach,Wildwood,MO,"This course should be used in every college that is training new coaches. It was valuable to learn about many mistakes I've made in the past, but also being encouraged by many things I have done right as well."

2015-11-13,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Limb,Phillip,Coach,Cameron,MO,This course helped me learn the greater purpose in coaching. It is a great tool and resource.

2015-11-01,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Rohlfing,Mallory,Coach,Town & Country,MO,This course really makes you think about why you coach! It helped me focus on what matters during the season. I appreciated the different categories so I could really aim to work on specific topics that my team was struggling with and that I wasn't doing well as a coach.
2015-10-31,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Smith,James,Coach,Fenton,MO,This course was valuable because it teaches coaches how to focus on become a relationship builder and not a victory accumulator. It will help anyone grow as a person and as a coach.
2015-10-29,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Ferrara,David,Coach,Kansas City,MO,This entire program is valuable. I guess the biggest thing I got was from the sessions on confidence because now I have somewhere to go to for help in building these kids up. I recommend this course to other coaches. I hope to have my assistant coaches take this course.
2015-10-26,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Delaney,Beth,Coach,Faucett,MO,"I got a lot of different ideas to do with my girls like the eagle drill. Being a coach is more than just teaching fundamentals (1st dimension). Although I knew I needed to build relationships with my athletes, this course helped me put my focus back onto the more important things."
2015-10-14,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Thompson,Ed,Coach,Florissant,MO,I would recommend this course to other coaches. This is very good if you are serious about coaching sports.

I have been given an incredible opportunity as a coach, and I loved getting the tools that I now have that will help me to encourage and teach my young ladies- in all three dimensions. Such awesome wisdom and ideas. Thanks!"
2015-10-06,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Coleman,Doug,Coach,Chesterfield,MO,Thinking through the 3 dimensions and how each level is applied in my basketball program was a very useful practice. I'm hoping to be able to recognize which dimension an issue is in and diagnose the problem quickly with the appropriate dimension. I would recommend this course to others because coaches are reflective practitioners and should always be looking for ways to evaluate ways to coach more effectively.
2015-09-11,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Reilly,Sharon,Coach,St. Louis,MO,The most valuable part of this course was the distinct three dimensions of a holistic coaching approach and learning to understand the value of all three.

2015-08-05,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Edwards,Katelyn,Coach,Cameron,MO,This course provides a different view on things and really makes you evaluate what you do as a coach. Receiving the suggestions at the end of the course about how to implement the strategies was very valuable.

2015-05-23,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Turner,Lacey,Coach,Temple,TX,HS Coaches need to be reminded what coaching is really about; less about statistics and data more about relationships and lessons. I believe that all coaches and even teachers should experience this course. Children are our next leaders/inventors/creators; if we can invest in them at a young age and provide them a learning environment that is servant they have the opportunity to be 3D leaders in our future.
2015-02-08,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Smith,Lucas,Coach,Hicksville,OH,"The journey was the most valuable thing I got out of taking this course... the idea that I need to transform myself first so I can transform others. I know this will help empower me to become my best. I am taking this to the community. We need to educate parents, youth coaches etc. This is life changing."
