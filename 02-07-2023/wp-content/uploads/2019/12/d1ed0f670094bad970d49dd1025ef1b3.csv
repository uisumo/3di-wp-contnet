Having helped coach a youth program as part of student athlete coaches giving back to build the program I was comfortable with just helping.  I soon concluded that the other coaches not only didnt have experience playing the sport they were coaching but no experience coaching other than helping for a year or two with the current program.  To add to it the head coach was over commited to other programs and state level youth programs and was looking to find a suitable replacement.  I started making notes to what we should practice and how we should condition and that led to me being asked to take the team over.  It started off well and great effort and improvement however my skills as a coach were from twenty years ago as a highschool student and more suited for highschool athelets and adult learning.  Looking back I seen what this coures considers 3D coaching but didn't really acknowledge how and why.  As I found training courses for myself and my assistant coaches I found this course and not only does it follow teachings of my professional life but what I was exposed to long ago.  The intent is not only will the assistant coaches complete the sport specific certifications I have already mandated but also work their way to completing this course to ensure we are focused on the athletes developement not just in sport but in life.  Our program is an investment in the future program not a sell out results now program.

When the time is right I will recall the presentations and use them to serve as a validating foundation for what we are about to do. 

I would keep the slides concise and to the point and add the commentary contained in the slides to the Ted Talk format.  All of the information is important. Personally, I feel more engaged when I am watching the presentation at the end than when I am watching the instructional slides.  There is a certain anticipation about them, I found myself leaning in and wondering what golden nugget of information is just ahead.  I also was reflecting during the presentation slides and drawing connections to my own experience.  I found them to be a powerful learning tool.

I also found value when I had a chance to write a response as part of a learning check.","This is very difficult material to cover in an online course.  

Many of the 3-D principles lend themselves to a live conversation or presentation.  I feel that the 3-D staff did an excellent job of covering meaningful material in a challenging format (online learning).  

I am looking forward to receiving the online news letters and communications from the 3-D staff.  I think it will help me keep focus on what is really important during the up-coming competitive season.

Reaching students is the name of the game for me, and so I believed in this program long before I'd ever heard of it.  The planning section was a bit ridiculous to go through one by one.  Perhaps an overview page with a very short informational line about each one, so that ""coaches"" can go through the ones that would best suit their needs.  This was a very long course, and that section made it a bit ridiculous.","Getting to know your student athletes, and in my case singers and dancers, is a must.

The 3D Institute brings together the coaching philosophies of Jeff Duke, Joe Ehrmann, and many others and teaches it to coaches worldwide so they can effectively reach the hearts and minds of athletes.  

Over the years, I have implemented many 3D strategies and every single one of them have been wildly successful in positively shaping the cultures of the teams I have coached.  Any coach who is good enough to play a sport in college can pickup on any X's and O's they need to know in a day and many can talk about the X's and O's nonstop.  However, the more challenging task is forging strong leaders and shaping organizational culture.  Coaches who really want to develop leaders must be intentional about the process and the 3D framework shows you how to do so.  

I have seen too many coaches get into the game simply because they like the X's and O's.  Not every coach I know will be willing, committed, and intentional about leadership development to the level 3D demands.  The ones who are committed and intentional about leadership development will dominate the game and beyond.  

If I am ever the Head Coach of my own football program, 3D Coaching Certification will be mandatory for all of my assistants.  It is that good.

I struggled year after year to find a way to fill the gaps in my coaching philosophies and practices. I'd had seasons when we nearly came out with top finishes for our program, and I'd had seasons when we nearly bottomed out. I always walked away with that bad taste in my mouth, that taste that would keep me up late at night questioning myself. Had I done the right things? Was I the right coach for this job? Was it time to step away and hand the reins to someone more able-bodied? Yet year after year, I received enough affirmations from parents and former wrestlers that I kept going. Through a series of difficulties and doubting moments, I happened to end up taking the 3 Dimension Coaching Course. I'm proud to say that much of WHAT I believed has been affirmed through the course, but even more so, I now have a much clearer idea and vision of HOW I can help my athletes.

,Mike,,Sanderson,,Coach     (former Athletic Director),Have the Integrity to Teach and Model Greatness through Goodness to bring Wisdom and Joy to those I touch.,mbs@lclark.edu,1972 W Muirhead Lp,,Tucson,Arizona,85737,United States,Male,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"The presentation is hypocritical.  One of the key components focuses on intrinsic, not extrinsic, motivation in our lives and those we teach.  The entire presentation moves from extrinsic reward to the next (e.g. ""Congratulations"", ""100% score"", ""You have completed ___"".  This approach should be changed or altered.

The process is demeaning.  An intrinsically motivated, committed learner  does not need to take fill-in, true-false, etc. quizzes on what has just been presented in order to learn.  I found this unnecessary and offensive.

An individual who is committed to the 3D philosophy does not need a certificate, trophy or reward, in order to engage in a meaningful transformational process.  Again, this is hypocritical to the central focus of this course.","The content of this course is outstanding.  It reviewed and refreshed knowledge I already had.  It introduced a framework and a significant amount of new knowledge that will make be a better person, family member, and professional.  All of the speakers are outstanding -- knowledgeable, articulate, inspirational, and genuine.  The length of each segment seemed appropriate.  The ideas and resources provided will be valuable tools to use in the immediate and near future.  Thank you for all of the above!

As I stated earlier, please eliminate the hypocrisy of the extrinsic reward process and the demeaning quizzes along the way.  This will give the presentation and overall course much more credibility.

It challenges coaches to get to the heart of an athlete. In my experience to date, I have not been a part of a more valuable professional development. As a result of this content, we implemented 3D Coaching Sessions that all coaches were welcome to attend. We met once a week for the remainder of the school year and are still doing so this summer.

Incidentally, I was exposed to intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation. I have competed nearly my entire life and never really 'got' how my own sons were never overly excited to wander around in their medals after a long tourney. Looking at the whole picture, I see that they are wrestling...for intrinsic purposes. They enjoy the competition, trying their takedowns, 'the sport,' and the 'game.' Knowing the difference, I am able to motivate much better, but, again, am validated in my own, already built, system for wrestling: (1.)FOUNDATION: We will build a foundation, fundamentally-strong, that will easily translate to any program, (2.)
