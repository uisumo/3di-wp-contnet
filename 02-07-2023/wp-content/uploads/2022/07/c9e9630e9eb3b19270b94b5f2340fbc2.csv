Overall, I think the 3D Coaching materials will be a great tool for our coaches. I am looking at this program from the perspective that we have over 150 coaches in our K-12 Athletic program. We have a passion for building a feeder program where our coaches are involved in an intentional and consistent progressive development approach. Our consistent 3 essentials are for all of our coaches is that we desire they be investing in our athletes physically, relationally, and spiritually. This was our goal before we learned about the 3D Institute and is why this program for coaches has drawn our attention. You have the tools and experience to help our coaches in something that is a part of our heart, desire, and goal. It is our hope to be able to use a variety of different 3D materials throughout our wide range and levels of our coaches. I am still going though all of the 3D courses, but what I felt was lacking in this Essentials Course was that I am not sure it would fire up our coaches to WANT to do the full certificate program. Personally, I would have liked to have seen some engagement for the coach or more about the outcome success of the overall program for the individual athlete and the team. What I remember most about the course is the positive and negative of some coaches but not so much about the outcomes success of the program.","As an overview of the 3D program, I felt it lacked something in comparison to other materials I have looked at from the 3D Institute. I love much of the 3D material and it hits home with a great need for our coaches to be working in all 3 dimensions but this fell a little short. We are going to provide the 3D Certificate program for our varsity head coaches. I was planning on using the Essentials Course for our assistant coaches and middle school coaches in hopes it would give them some fundamental background on the program and encourage them to go further into the certificate program if they desired. I may need to find additional ways to accomplish this goal.","No","8667","50508","2020-04-09 09:40:14","https://3dinstitute.com/module/15-level-2-and-3-strategies/","","","","","","Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_4) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/13.1 Safari/605.1.15","71.59.47.156","2","","6e5618c13f18a3625f80786677a11a67","","",""

After starting the first couple sections of the course I was very excited to dive deeper. I realized that this one was a quick overview and did not go as in-depth as I would like to go. I was looking to get more ideas for implementing these ideas and concepts with my team so in order to continue to learn and grow the next day I signed up for the actually course.  Cannot wait to change the course and future of our program for years to come!!","Yes","2376","11680","2017-09-23 08:56:39","https://3dinstitute.com/module/15-level-2-and-3-strategies/","","","","","","Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/52.0.2743.116 Safari/537.36 Edge/15.15063","68.188.132.251","1","","","","",""
