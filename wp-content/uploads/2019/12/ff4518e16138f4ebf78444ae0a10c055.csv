Having helped coach a youth program as part of student athlete coaches giving back to build the program I was comfortable with just helping.  I soon concluded that the other coaches not only didnt have experience playing the sport they were coaching but no experience coaching other than helping for a year or two with the current program.  To add to it the head coach was over commited to other programs and state level youth programs and was looking to find a suitable replacement.  I started making notes to what we should practice and how we should condition and that led to me being asked to take the team over.  It started off well and great effort and improvement however my skills as a coach were from twenty years ago as a highschool student and more suited for highschool athelets and adult learning.  Looking back I seen what this coures considers 3D coaching but didn't really acknowledge how and why.  As I found training courses for myself and my assistant coaches I found this course and not only does it follow teachings of my professional life but what I was exposed to long ago.  The intent is not only will the assistant coaches complete the sport specific certifications I have already mandated but also work their way to completing this course to ensure we are focused on the athletes developement not just in sport but in life.  Our program is an investment in the future program not a sell out results now program.  This course along with the parents training will be the cornerstone to guiding this program and rebuilding the community.

The 3D Institute brings together the coaching philosophies of Jeff Duke, Joe Ehrmann, and many others and teaches it to coaches worldwide so they can effectively reach the hearts and minds of athletes.  

Over the years, I have implemented many 3D strategies and every single one of them have been wildly successful in positively shaping the cultures of the teams I have coached.  Any coach who is good enough to play a sport in college can pickup on any X's and O's they need to know in a day and many can talk about the X's and O's nonstop.  However, the more challenging task is forging strong leaders and shaping organizational culture.  Coaches who really want to develop leaders must be intentional about the process and the 3D framework shows you how to do so.  

I have seen too many coaches get into the game simply because they like the X's and O's.  Not every coach I know will be willing, committed, and intentional about leadership development to the level 3D demands.  The ones who are committed and intentional about leadership development will dominate the game and beyond.  

If I am ever the Head Coach of my own football program, 3D Coaching Certification will be mandatory for all of my assistants.  It is that good.  It is that necessary."

I struggled year after year to find a way to fill the gaps in my coaching philosophies and practices. I'd had seasons when we nearly came out with top finishes for our program, and I'd had seasons when we nearly bottomed out. I always walked away with that bad taste in my mouth, that taste that would keep me up late at night questioning myself. Had I done the right things? Was I the right coach for this job? Was it time to step away and hand the reins to someone more able-bodied? Yet year after year, I received enough affirmations from parents and former wrestlers that I kept going. Through a series of difficulties and doubting moments, I happened to end up taking the 3 Dimension Coaching Course. I'm proud to say that much of WHAT I believed has been affirmed through the course, but even more so, I now have a much clearer idea and vision of HOW I can help my athletes.

The concepts of 3D speak to the essence of why coaches coach as well as how to win the heart of athletes.  If you want to experience the best possible professional development as a coach, 3D Coaching is a must!"
Jeremy,Reed,Coach,,,,,Altus,OK,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I would recommend this course because it gives coaches an insight on some very important topics that are never addressed anywhere else.
Gene,Peluso,Coach,,,,,Branchburg,NJ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course gave me hope for my future in coaching. The tools and ideas it provided can help me enjoy the process and have my athletes also enjoy the process.I would absolutely recommend this course because it is positive and thought provoking.
Jason,Kurz,Athletic Director,,,,,Maryville,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"Professional development is a necessity for educators and coaches. We all must continue to learn, grow, and exchange ideas with others. However, the focus of those sessions rarely reaches the personal level that it should. 3D Coaching does. When our coaches experienced 3D Coaching, there was substantial growth that took place. 3Dimensional Coaching focuses on the connections with kids and with people. It challenges coaches to get to the heart of an athlete. In my experience to date, I have not been a part of a more valuable professional development. As a result of this content, we implemented 3D Coaching Sessions that all coaches were welcome to attend. We met once a week for the remainder of the school year and are still doing so this summer. Those of us regulars have gotten a great deal from it. We have grown as coaches, and as people. I can't stress enough how beneficial 3Dimensional Coaching can be for you, your department or coaching staff.<blockquote style=margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px; border: currentcolor; border-image-source: none;>Jason Kurz"
Corey,Johnson,Coach,,,,,Albany,NY,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course will change the way coaches approach their athletes.
Anna,Nutt,Coach,,,,,Platte City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"If I would have had this my first year of coaching 28 years ago, what a different coach I would have been.  I was definitely that 1st dimensional coach. The 2nd and 3rd dimension tools were the most valuable thing I got out of taking this course."
Josh,Arnsman,Coach,,,,,Mendon,IL,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"Not only would I recommend this course to other coaches, I would also recommend this to entire school districts. There are a lot of great things in here that would help teachers better relate to students and get more out of them in class."
Dave,Degarmo,Coach,,,,,Quincy,IL,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"This course is a guide to where I want to be as a coach. Everything becomes so clear in these presentations. It shows what I have felt, but what I have not been able to articulate. I would absolutely recommend this course, and I already have contacted coaches and AD's from other schools. It is an easy to follow, eye opening program."
Steve,Garr,Coach,,,,,Plattsburg,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course gave me a better understanding of the effect coaches have. I think it would be a good course for anyone in a leadership position.
Christopher,Alexander,Coach,,,,,St. Joseph,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"This course allows the coach to be more than just a sport-specific coach, but in many ways a life coach as well. Learning specific techniques of how to care and show compassion for my students, and show what I need to fix for myself in order to make myself and (more importantly) my students succeed inside and outside the classroom was the most valuable part."
Tyrone,Seymour,Coach,,,,,Kansas City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"This course gave me concrete ways to consistently coach in the 3rd dimension. Most coaches talk about motivation and impacting lives, this gives the tools to do so."
Mike,Clayton,USA Wrestling,,,,,Colorado Springs,CO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course provides amazing examples that will help coaches raise self-awareness of their actions (and the effects of their actions) as well as tools to implement positive change. We will make this course a highly encouraged option for USA Wrestling's Coach Education Program.
Alese,Speckhart,Coach,,,,,Quincy,IL,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,3,The way to motivate kids and developing other dimensions to coaching was the most valuable thing I got out of this course. It provides a lot of great points and insights to young coaches especially.
Jeff,Humburg,Coach,,,,,Platte City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Learning about the amount of student/player feedback I can give was great stuff. It is a fresh approach to coaching to what needs to be in the 21st century.
Todd,Jaros,Coach,,,,,Platte City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Knowing how to coach is a different beast now-a-days. This program hits it right on the head.
Jamar,Parrish,Coach,,,,,Kansas City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course helps me remember to show every kid they are loved and appreciated beyond what they do on the playing field. I think everyone could benefit in some way from this course.
Harry,"Jenness, Jr",Coach,,,,,Rosemount,MN,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I was able to self reflect on my coaching over the  years.  I had the opportunity to read the book last year and take the course this summer.  It allowed me to look over the notes I highlighted from the book while watching the videos.  I also liked the spiritual reflection with Jeff and Mark to take it to another dimension.  I had a purpose statement prior to the course as required by the Minnesota State High School League after hearing Dr. Jeff Duke speak in person, had the opportunity to meet him and started this journey.  After taking this course I revised my purpose statement with much more meaning.  Overall a sense of self-reflection to become a whole coach in the 3-dimensions. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course to other coaches! I think it is a course that every coach should take and reflect back before every season.  I know I will continue to grow as a coach and teacher for the betterment of my players and students.  I plan to share with enthusiasm the ideas with other coaches to encourage them to start or take their journey to another level."
Dan,Nagel,Asst. Principal/Athletic Director,,,,,Chillicothe,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"The 3D Coaching workshop our entire coaching staff at Chillicothe High School participated in was extremely valuable for us. It opened the eyes and inspired our young coaches and veteran coaches as well to be great leaders of athletes and be a positive influence in impacting many lives as a coach.  The 3D Coaching workshop directly applied to every coach as it did not focus on the X and O's of a particular sport, but focused on motivating student athletes in a positive way.  This area is a huge challenge for coaches when dealing with the modern day athlete.  Veteran and young coaches alike on our staff commented to me that it was a very valuable use of their time and they were glad that they had attended after the workshop was over.  Wes is a great speaker and interacted with our coaches in an engaging manner.  The 3D Coaching workshop material focusing on building a TEAM in a positive way will be implemented by many of our coaches."
Jacob,Meyer,Coach,,,,,Cameron,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course will only help you to become a better coach and allow you to better meet the needs of your players.
Dave,Boehm,Coach,,,,,Orlando,FL,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I will be recommending this course to every coach I know.  Along with Joe's (Ehrmann) book, this course has had the single most positive impact on my coaching career.  I was at a crossroads and came across this course at the exact right time.  It has renewed my passion for working with young people by giving me concrete strategies I can put into practice immediately."
Terry,Hopkins,Coach,,,,,Maryville,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I feel that understanding how to motivate in the second level will help me the most. It makes so much sense to use 'play' instead of the term 'outwork'. Today's athletes live in a very different world than it was even ten years ago.  This course provides ideas to teach/coach the entire student athlete.
Rick,Hodge,Coach,,,,,Platte City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I would recommend this course to other coaches because it is a different way of looking at coaching, not just through the first dimension. The ideas on building relationships with players and parents were very valuable."
Aaron,Cooper,Coach,,,,,Union Star,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,I would recommend this course to other coaches.  There are a lot of things in this course that you touch base with that you may forget about in the whirlwind of the season. I got some helpful tips and exercises to use with my team.
Valorie,Stokes,Coach,,,,,Platte City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The very clear and thorough explanations and examples of the 3 dimensions and thinking about the purpose that motivates me was very valuable. I would definitely recommend this course to other coaches because it covers a range of important topics that are very relevant to coaching sports in our current cultural context and gives great strategies for focusing on and creating success on and off the field.
Dakota,Neisen,Coach,,,,,Mendon,IL,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I would recommend this course because it brings the necessity of player development as people to the forefront. It was valuable because it reminds me that coaching is not completely about winning.
Rebecca,Zylstra,Coach,,,,,Brentwood,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I loved the list of strategies at the end. This course is full of inspirational content and puts a phenomenal perspective on what we should be doing as coaches.
Chad,Cook,Coach,,,,,Inola,OK,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I truly have been praying for something like this in my own life, and would recommend to others. The most valuable thing I got out of this class was the fact that I believed that I was coaching in the other dimensions, but rather just used verbiage from the 2nd and 3rd dimension but never taught it."
Tara,Deckard,Coach,,,,,Kansas City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course was valuable because it provided me with validation of establishing relationships with others to promote effective results.
Shawn,Noppert,Coach,,,,,Pompton Plains,NJ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"The reinforcement of the core values need to be a successful coach was very valuable. Also being an elder in our church and mentoring kids everyday, using the 2nd and 3rd dimension and not even realizing it. It opened my eyes to a lot of thing and reinforced others as well."
Andrew,Cook,Coach,,,,,Burlington,WA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,This course will help coaches understand the difference between being a good and a great coach. This is the essence of connecting with your athletes at a level that is going to last a lifetime.
Eric,Mitchell,Coach,,,,,Platte City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Learning that there is more to coaching than just being great at the first dimension was very valuable. This course provided a great way for coaches to listen and reflect on this material and younger coaches to gain this knowledge now.
Dixie,Wirsig,Counselor,,,,,Kansas City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I feel this program is the foundation for success to helping students succeed. Learning about the different methods of building relationships with students, the journals, spotlight, and modeling to build students relationship was very valuable."
Riley,Weems,Coach,,,,,Broken Bow,NE,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,It's a great course that helps you to understand how to approach coaching from all aspects. Learning some strategies on how to deal with athletes in the area of motivation was very valuable.
Eddie,Schaaf,Coach,,,,,Broken Bow,NE,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Learning strategies on how to impact lives was the most valuable thing I got out of taking this course.
Rod,Elms,Coach,,,,,St. Joseph,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I would absolutely recommend this course to other coaches. There are too many coaches and parents who are living through their children and expect them to compete in college athletics.  This helps us get the big picture of why we need to prepare young student athletes for life, not sports. This course reminded me of why I coach and my need to try to keep play as number one aspect of competition."
Anthony,Barbrie,Coach,,,,,Savannah,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"Setting up a 3Dimensional Coaching Transformational Purpose was the most valuable thing I got out of taking this course. I would recommend this course to other coaches. The new ideas, concepts, and understanding in coaching is always helpful to help student athlete growth & success."
Tonya,Young,Coach,,,,,Savannah,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I would absolutely recommend this course to other coaches! The various techniques I can use with the athletes to help them become more positive with each other and be a unit of one was very valuable. Great information.
Mark,Pearson,Coach,,,,,Pottstown,PA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course reinforced my understanding that the primary role of a coach is to produce good human beings. It gets to the heart of what it means to be a coach.
Andrew,Nicola,Coach,,,,,Riverside,CA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"I would absolutely recommend this course to every coach. The reason for this is because I believe we all have a plan to coach in the 3rd dimension, but we get side tracked and forget what it is really all about. This is a great reminder to put some things in stone that we want to implement as coaches. I gained more strategies to continue to do what I feel as if I have already been doing in my short coaching career. It's reassuring knowing that others think the way I think."
Megan,Beck,Coach,,,,,St. Joseph,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The new perspective on coaching and the realization of the role that I play in athlete's lives was very valuable. I love this approach to coaching and can see how beneficial it is.
Larry,Linthacum,Superintendent,,,,,Jefferson City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"The 3Dimensional Coaching curriculum is a natural fit for our district. Our core values include learning, character, leadership and collaboration which match the 3D values. This curriculum gave our coaches and administrators ideas and practical tools to infuse these values in our student athletes."
Mark,Lardy,Coach,,,,,Bismarck,ND,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The most valuable part of this course was the idea that we need to have a purpose that is larger than our goals. True success is measured off of our purpose not our goals. I would recommend this course to other coaches. I already have talked to a number of coaches about doing it.
Neal,Hook,Athletic Director,,,,,St. Joseph,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"?Central High School held a 3D Coaching professional development workshop this spring for all of our coaches.  The information, purpose and direction acquired in the seminar has inspired our coaches to implement daily character building opportunities for our student/athletes to go beyond the fundamental stage of sports.  Our coaches have a better understanding of the significance in developing values within the players that motivates them to maximize their individual potential and to reach team goals. 3D Coaching has refined our perspective on coaching.?"
Blake,Forkey,Coach,,,,,Avon,CT,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"Being a beginner coach, this course set a clear path for the actions I should take and implement to have the most impact on my players and fellow coaches. I recommend this course to other coaches. I believe that every coach needs to understand or be reminded of the athlete as being a person with life problems and emotional stresses."
Donald,Beazizo,Athletic Director,,,,,Burlington,WA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I would definitely recommend this course. This course has exactly how I would perceive our coaches developing the same relationships with their players as I have when I was a coach. As an athletic director, it will be a nice addition to our coaching staff as a requirement."
Samantha,Jackson,Coach,,,,,Oregon,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"I enjoyed researching the different strategies to implement in the season and even off season that this course provides. This course is necessary because our athletes are changing, and this is helpful to decide how to approach that."
Marlin,Roach,Athletic Director,,,,,Cameron,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The most valuable thing I got out of taking this course was just taking some time to think about the important things coaches need to be focused on instead of just the W's and L's. I would absolutely recommend this course to other coaches. All coaches can benefit from the topics discussed.
Robert,Holkesvik,Coach,,,,,Decorah,IA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"What I got most from this coarse was the knowledge of how a coach's interaction with his/her athletes can transcend their sport. I gained the realization that by moving to the next level of coaching I can transform athletes into adults. I believe this course should be a requirement to get a coaching endorsement. If a coach is only coaching Xs and Os, he/she is missing out on coaching the things that will matter when there athletes games are over."
Aaron,Fritz,Coach,,,,,Faucett,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I would recommend this course to other coaches because it is a great way to learn other ways to motivate/inspire people and learn about the importance of things outside of sport.
Jeremy,Stukenholtz,Athletic Director,,,,,Council Bluffs,IA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course helps coaches refocus on what is truly important. Our entire coaching staff will be going through the course.
Leonard,Grodoski,Coach,,,,,Chrystal Lake,IL,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I appreciate the reasoning and research presented behind these new concepts. I felt it would be good for every coach to hear these concepts and utilize them.
John,Pearson,Coach,,,,,Des Moines,IA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course just gives you a better way to coach. Moving forward I believe I can become a better person and coach.
Brian,Dolph,Coach,,,,,Haddonfield,NJ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The combination of the insight coincided with the videos. Very powerful! It is a great tool for coaching at all levels!
Mike,McKee,Athletic Director,,,,,Lynden,WA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I was able to come up with a concrete plan of action to present to my coaching staff through the organization of this course. I would recommend this course. It challenges you to go deeper with your coach-athlete relationships.
Seth,Kinkaid,Media Relations,,,,,Olathe,KS,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The information and tools provided by this course are very important if you as a coach want to help develop your players into well rounded people and have the most long term impact. The required reading of Inside Out Coaching was really eye opening and very informative. Joe's writing style and storytelling was very interesting and motivating.
Tom,Smith,Coach,,,,,West Des Moines,IA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The overall concept of 3D coaching plus strategies to help us was very valuable. This course was very beneficial and I love the overall concept.
Rex,Janssen,Coach,,,,,Ballwin,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,I would recommend this course to other coaches because it was and can be a good reminder as to why we are coaching. It served as a valuable reminder that coaching is more than just about winning and losing.
James,Wenzel,Coach,,,,,Powell,WY,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,This course helped me to not be narrow minded within my teachings. I would recommend it to other coaches. It helps reduce the goal and success orientation of parents nowadays.
Carl,Nini,Athletic Director,,,,,Marrero,LA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course helped me to see that most coaches stay in level 1 and we need to work on reaching all 3 levels of our athletes. I would like to have all my coaches take the course.
Clint,Smith,Coach,,,,,Marshfield,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course! I think a lot of my methods, tactics, and reasons for coaching were validated. It is nice. This course digs considerably deeper in ways to reach our kids and somewhat forces the coach to get an idea of how, what, why, etc. we should be coaching 3-dimensionally. I was intrigued, and subsequently, am a better coach already, having seen a fraction of 3D Coaching over the Summer at Silver College for USA Wrestling at University of Wisconsin. Incidentally, I was exposed to intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation. I have competed nearly my entire life and never really 'got' how my own sons were never overly excited to wander around in their medals after a long tourney. Looking at the whole picture, I see that they are wrestling...for intrinsic purposes. They enjoy the competition, trying their takedowns, 'the sport,' and the 'game.' Knowing the difference, I am able to motivate much better, but, again, am validated in my own, already built, system for wrestling: (1.)FOUNDATION: We will build a foundation, fundamentally-strong, that will easily translate to any program, (2.) SUCCESS: We will help define success based on our athletes' unique skills/needs and, then, help them find it. (3.) FUN: perhaps, most-important, we will teach, learn, and compete in a way that is fun for all involved."
Mark,Faust,Athletic Director,,,,,Peoria,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course gave me hope that there is a better way to coach and there are strategies in place that can be utilized for coaches to pursue excellence through goodness. I would absolutely recommend this course. I am an Athletic Director - I heard Dr.  Duke speak at the National AD's Conference in Florida - I now have a vision to move forward with a comprehensive professional development for all my coaches.
Adam,Simons,Coach,,,,,Lynchburg,VA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,I recommend this course to other coaches. It is eye opening to the other aspects of coaching that are rarely discussed in typical coaching education. Learning about coaching more than the fundamentals and physical side of the sport was very valuable. Reaching athletes on higher levels to help them reach their potential.
Mike,Garner,Coach,,,,,Broken Bow,NE,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I am definitely going to recommend it to my assistant coaches because I think it does a great job of emphasizing what the true purpose of sport should be. Too often we as coaches get caught up in the idea that it is all about wins and losses and we forget that it's all about kids.
Jamie,Crossno,Coach,,,,,Winslow,IL,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I started to use the tools in this course as soon as I learned them and they have help my team already. Learning how to talk to my wrestlers about more than just the mat and school was the most valuable part of taking this course.
Luke,Coufal,Coach,,,,,Broken Bow,NE,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"The most valuable thing I got out of taking this course was taking the time and reflecting on my own coaching, and what I will change as a result of this reflection. I feel if more coaches coached in the 2nd and 3rd dimensions we would see greater participation in sports at the high school level."
Mike,Schweitzer,Coach,,,,,Broken Bow,NE,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I learned a lot about myself and about how I want my programs to look. I feel that this course is just going to make my program better and stronger.
Mark,Royer,Coach,,,,,Council Bluffs,IA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I recommend this course for coaches. Every coach can be better. Plain and simple. I feel I do a really good job, but this showed me ways to be better."
Teresa,Swan,Coach,,,,,Faucett,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I recommend this course because you will learn the different levels of coaching. It was valuable to learn how to capture the hearts of our players.
Elemon Junior,Sakala,Coach,,,,,Lusaka,Zambia,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"This course is a tool we can use to resuscitate and reignite the very essence of coaching. It reminds us of the importance of coaching the Heart for transformation purposes, as opposed to the worldwide norm of transactional coaching."
Larry,McDonald,District Athletic Director,,,,,Durham,NC,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The lessons on the 2nd Dimension of coaching were very valuable. I would recommend this course because there are plenty of coaches who need to move their coaching to the next level.
Ron,Gray,Coach,,,,,Des Moines,IA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course affirmed my coaching philosophy and mission statement. I would recommend this course other coaches. All coaches can get something out of the course. Many good ideas and concepts.
Amy,Taylor,Coach,,,,,Broken Bow,NE,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I felt that this course offered a deeper level of compassion that some of our coaches and coaching programs are missing. I would recommend this course to other coaches because it provides a purpose that we should all strive to complete as a coach.
Harley,Mohlman,Coach,,,,,Broken Bow,NE,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course really shows the more importance of why you coach instead of how. The ways on how to build the relationships with the kids to bring a better commitment & enthusiasm into my programs. were the most valuable part.
Kurt,Altig,Coach,,,,,Broken Bow,NE,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"This course allowed me to reflect on my own coaching strategies, to coach outside of the 1st dimension.  It will make me a better coach, and in turn help my athletes be more successful. I would recommend it to other coaches because it gives great strategies to help coach the present day athlete."
Blake,Seifert,Coach,,,,,Platte City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I think the most valuable piece of this course was my self reflection on the impact I want to make for my student athletes. I would definitely recommend this course to other coaches because I think it is a valuable tool to making you a better person and educator.
Randy,Sneed,Coach,,,,,Kansas City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course has brought tears to my eyes several times and it just brings out the best in you. Just the overall way it was explained and detailed was awesome.

David,Lehman,Coach,,,,,Keller,TX,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"Without 3D level coaching our young athletes are missing the opportunity for a life changing experience. I would recommend this course 100%! Not just for coaches of all levels, but also for parents."

Leisa,Blair,Principal,,,,,Savannah,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"The 3D Coaching content gave my coaches the opportunity to come together as a small group and learn about the importance of the three different dimensions of coaching.

This helps me to be confident to push myself to do more of it and has given me some specific strategies to use.

Heather,Wilson,Coach,,,,,Altamont,KS,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I would definitely recommend this course, especially to experienced coaches who have their minds set on doing it the same way they always have. Coaching from the heart is more important than wins and losses."

Nate,Thomas,Coach,,,,,Marshfield,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I absolutely recommend this course. It makes you take a step back and evaluate yourself as a coach and how you go about your daily interactions with the student-athletes you coach.

I have seen and felt a difference in my coaching but more importantly, others have noticed that I have went from a transactional coach to a transformational coach."
Grey,Powell,Athletic Director,,,,,Edmond,OK,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"The entire course was great! The sections 201 & 301 were incredibly helpful in packaging thoughts, ideas & practices that I have been doing and assigning & aligning them with our purpose. As an AD I will be asking my coaches to take this course. It is impactful and transformative. Very clear and concise while being complex and groundbreaking."
Melanie,Herring,Coach,,,,,Rice Lake,WI,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,I know many coaches that would greatly benefit from this course.  They could use the strategies to better connect with parents and athletes and realize that there is much more to coaching than teaching 'skills.'  We have a much greater impact than we think. Learning specific strategies and ways to take my coaching to the 3rd dimension was the most valuable part of this course.
Christian,Swain,Coach,,,,,Portland,OR,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I would recommend this course because I believe it is important for us to remember the 'why' in what we do. I enjoyed the motivation section the most.
Rich,Skillman,Coach,,,,,Everson,WA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The most valuable thing I got out of taking this course was understanding the purpose of why I coach and being able to explain it in words. I believe that this course demonstrates the true meaning of what it means to be a coach and I would recommend it to other coaches.
Scott,Hereder,Coach,,,,,Peoria,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I would recommend this course to other coaches because students need more than just level one coaches. There needs to be more level 3 coaches.
Shelby,Forman,Coach,,,,,Platte City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"Learning different ways to approach student athletes without just focusing on their skill level was the most valuable part of this course. I would recommend this course because unfortunately, our world is so skill based and win-oriented that we as coaches need to be more aware of other factors that have significant impact on our athletes."
Jonathan,McDonald,Coach,,,,,St. Charles,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"It is a valuable tool that enables us to determine and achieve our intended goals as a coach, and gave ots of ideas and examples of how to be a 3D coach."
Layne,Louallen,Coach,,,,,Ozark,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"This course really does get you thinking about how many ways there really are to get to an athlete in a deeper way to see them shine. The most valuable parts: Digging in deeper to the athletes, hearing more of they want out of you and themselves not just having goals set from day one working to accomplish those. Letting the kids decide what athletes they are going to be and trying to use all the tools available to develop them where they want to go."
Kailey,Bridges,Coach,,,,,Springfield,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"I would absolutely recommend this course to other coaches. Narrowing down my core values as a coach, and thinking more about what is really important to teach kids over the course of a season was the most valuable thing for me."
Diane,Storey,Coach,,,,,Council Bluffs,IA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The one thing I have struggled with in coaching is working on motivation and mental toughness. This course affirmed some of the things I already do and gave me some additional strategies to use. I would recommend this course because coaches have a great impact on their athletes and we have a responsibility to make sure the impact is positive.
Josh,Bullock,Coach,,,,,Council Bluffs,IA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The video clips from the different movies because I could relate it to information that I have already seen. I would recommend this course because it gives a different outlook on ways to coach.
David,Gray,Coach,,,,,Marshfield,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,This course gave me new ways to look at my athletes and help make them better people. I think the ideas are sound and will really work to create better coaches and athletes.
Makenna,Durham,Coach,,,,,Council Bluffs,IA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"This course gave me healthy reminders and refreshing motivation for the upcoming seasons. I would recommend this course to other coaches. For those with less experience it would be very informative and helpful for our area's demographic, and for experienced coaches it is a great reminder."
Derek,Yost,Coach,,,,,Platte City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"The steps and procedures to develop the important 2nd and 3rd dimensions were the most valuable part for me. I'd recommend this course to other coaches. Great course, for any level."
Martin,Warren,Coach,,,,,Cherryvale,KS,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I believe the losing to win module was a very heartfelt part of this course. If people can take this to help their athletes and students to perform their daily life, it will make this a better world. The 2nd and 3rd dimension is so much more valuable than the 1st dimension."
Danny,Lugo,Coach,,,,,Platte City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"The Videos about the Girls Basketball and Boys Football Team trying season were very moving. It would be easy to coach a team that wins 100% of the time, but I think to test the well of us Coaches sometimes going through a season like that will show us who we really are. It's not always about X's and O's but about getting to know your players and what motivates them; who are they and what concerns and fears they have on and off the field. I feel if you know your player and what they are about will help you on the field as well."
Joel,Howard,Coach,,,,,Sedro Woolley,WA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,The fact that we can help our players with much more than just play a sport is so valuable to remember! I found this course inspiring and it has given me a new outlook on coaching!
Cheratin,Hunter,Coach,,,,,Marshfield,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course was very helpful on how to relate to athletes today.
Rachel,Baker,Coach,,,,,Kansas City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,I would recommend this course because it focuses on the relationships with athletes versus just teaching them skills. It will help build life-long memories and have a lasting effect. The most valuable thing was to learn different strategies to use throughout the year to model the 2nd and 3rd dimensions of coaching.
Devin,Springer,Coach,,,,,Platte City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I would recommend this tool because it made real world connections. The strategies for the 3rd dimension were the most valuable part.
Courtland,Ingram,Coach,,,,,Smithville,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,I think it is important for many coaches to ask the question on why they are coaching and if it is about the kids first or themselves. The strategies for connecting with kids were valuable. I am glad to see how positive coaching is making a push into athletes today.
Zach,Keith,Coach,,,,,Platte County,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,The strategies to implement immediately were the most valuable part of this course to me. I recommend it because it offers insight into an area of coaching that many coaches who grew up playing their sport during a different era probably didn't see modeled.
Robert,Davenport,Coach,,,,,Platte County,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course has given me the opportunity to take a deep look at myself. I have become more intentional about acting like the coach that I want to be. I think this course allows us to view ourselves in the shoes of an athlete. Before this course I was in denial about things happening in our program.
David,Baker,Coach,,,,,Kansas City,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"It was nice to see that many of the strategies I already use as a coach are inline with the 3D coaching philosophy. It encourages me to continue in this way. I recommend this to other coaches, to new or young coaches especially."
Matt,Holt,Coach,,,,,Marshfield,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I recommend this course to other coaches. We use 'kids aren't the same today' too much. This gets to the heart of what we need to do to change with them. Writing the purpose statement was the most valuable part to me.
Curtis,Harland,Coach,,,,,Excello,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I think every new coach needs to take this course to help them bond with their kids. It provides new ways to connect with our youth.
Josh,Cook,Coach,,,,,Seymour,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"Overall I really enjoyed the course. I really enjoyed the 2nd dimension talks. I think they provided structure to thoughts I already had. I also really enjoyed the strategies, while I do not believe I will use them all, they definitely widen my scope of thinking."
Justin,Jordan,Coach,,,,,Ripley,MS,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I would recommend this course. It relates to the problems that coaches face on a daily basis, and gives the coach strategies to use to combat those problems. The different strategies to use to build the family concept of a team were very valuable."
Charles (Andy),Fedoris,Coach,,,,,Nebraska City,NE,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Great course for coaches. This ought to be required of coaches everywhere. Let coaches in on the real success to coaching young men/women.
Kent,Victor,Coach,,,,,Lynden,WA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,I recommend it to other coaches because it causes you to reflect on what's truly important in life. The emphasis on the levels 2 and 3 were the most valuable part.
Kristin,Keller,Coach,,,,,Town and Country,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course gave concrete methods coaches can use to increase the 2nd and 3rd dimension in their coaching skills. It motivated me to be a better coach and to evaluate the things I do well and the areas that need improvement.
Jessica,Gorham,Coach,,,,,Marshfield,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I would definitely recommend this course. Good things to think about. The 3D Coaching strategies/ideas for activities were the most valuable part.
Colter,Shacher,Coach,,,,,Adrian,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I would recommend this tool because it really opens your eyes as to what you need to focus on as a coach.Learning tat you need to get to the heart of the athlete and care for them as an individual not as a tool to achieve your goals was the most valuable part for me.
Jennifer,Aguirre,Coach,,,,,Council Bluffs,IA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"This course give great insight on how to be a great coach, how to build relationships and different strategies to use."
Jason,Schonberg,Coach,,,,,Stanwood,WA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I would recommend this course because it breaks down the generational gap many coaches are likely experiencing with the social media generation. We have to reach these kids through another strategy than the past.
Bo,Hampton,Coach,,,,,Coos Bay,OR,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I think this course opens the eyes of coaches and helps us to become a better coach. Learning that coaching is about more than just teaching wrestling was the most valuable part to me.
Amy,Becicka,Coach,,,,,Fairfax,IA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I would recommend this not only to coaches, but parents and any other professionals that work with kids. This is a much needed change in the mindset of what society believes about kids in athletics today."
Tony,Moceri,Coach,,,,,Bellingham,WA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I see this is a very important way to keep youth involved in sports so they can get the positive messages and build those relationships.
Kate,Gordon,Coach,,,,,West Branch,IA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This was by far one of the most reflective experiences I've ever had as a coach. The reflection on my purpose in coaching and how to make the greatest impact on my athletes' lives was the most valuable part. I definitely recommend it.
Kyle,Dalvit,Coach,,,,,Bellingham,WA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course offers a lot of valuable strategies that coaches can implement immediately. The combination of inspirational stories and practical strategies was the most valuable part.
Keith,Galloway,Coach,,,,,Knoxville,TN,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,This is something that all coaches can benefit from. The most frustrating thing a coach can deal with are heart issues. This program offers methods for attacking those issues. The 3rd dimension strategies and the 3D coaching certification worksheet were the most valuable part.
Laura,Torrero,Coach,,,,,Deming,WA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,This course puts your coaching in perspective and makes you more aware of what you do as a coach. I would recommend it to other coaches.
Zach,Merrill,Coach,,,,,Norman,OK,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I highly recommend this course for coaches. I definitely found the diamond among the roughs when it comes to coaching materials. Any coach can say, 'do this and that,' and you'll win guaranteed. However, this course teaches us that when you coach for developing the whole athlete (the spiritual, psychological, and physiological aspects), that's when you truly make a real difference in each of their lives. Learning about what it truly means to coach on the 2nd and 3rd dimension was the most valuable part. Skills that transcend coaching on the 1st dimension, which almost any coach can do. But coaching on the 2nd and 3rd dimension truly takes upstanding character, which we can cultivate and develop to produce other upstanding characters."
Sadie,Spanton,Coach,,,,,Shakopee,MN,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The most valuable thing I got out of this lesson is how to be a better coach and impact their lives. I recommend this course because it has many valuable lessons and how to become an impactful coach.
Cole,Dishman,Coach,,,,,Marshfield,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"I feel validated in some of the things I have been doing for my programs over the years.  I also learned their is more I could probably do, but I'm doing things the right way. I think this should be something every young/entry level position coaches should take."
Marcus,Cobbs,Coach,,,,,Cleveland,GA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"Team Cohesion is something that my team has been struggling with, and this helped me out a great deal with what to do for that. I would recommend this course to other coaches because it helps point out the other points of focus needed to be a successful coach."
Erik,Andersen,Coach,,,,,Peoria,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course helps guide you to becoming the coach we all want to be.
Damon,Seiger,Coach,,,,,Marshfield,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course is very informative and can open new doors for all coaches in reaching athletes on a different level. It gave me an understanding and different approach to coaching and mentoring.
Jennifer,Meyer,Coach,,,,,St. Louis,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"This course really made me focus on what matters and get me to think about what I'm doing. So much of this course was great, but I really needed that help to write the purpose statement and the step by step process to get there was very good."
Christopher,Pitts,Coach,,,,,Creve Coeur,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,3,The most valuable part was learning to recognize a kid struggling and being proactive at handling it. I recommend it to coaches because it gives you details in building morale.
Ben,MacKay,Coach,,,,,Burlington,WA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I have always felt that the most important aspects of coaching are the impact you can have on the lives of athletes. This reinforced that ideal and expanded my perspective tremendously. Additionally, this course gives tangible tools to implement the ideals. I'm excited to be on this journey. I'm going to recommend it to our club's director of coaching."
Michael,McMasters,Coach,,,,,Bellingham,WA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I would absolutely recommend this course! I don't feel that it is appropriate for an adult to coach a child unless the well-being of the child is their reason for being there. A coach who goes through this training would have to look at what they're doing, and ask themselves why they were there at all. A clearly delineated understanding of the various levels of coaching, as well as specific definitions that were backed up with research, were the most valuable thing to me. I loved that these weren't just 'common sense' approaches and that they had foundations in research."
Michael,Duran,Coach,,,,,Baldwin Park,CA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course is very enlightening and offers much value to coaches. Recognizing that we must evolve! We can not continue coaching in the first dimension alone.
Joe,Tabios,Coach,,,,,Shakopee,MN,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"I recommend this course because because I know a lot of folks that when they are coaching are only doing it in the 1st dimension, and not really taking anything else into consideration.  Connecting with players and realizing they are people too, and not just a tool to win shouldn't have to be a spoken thing, but with how coaches and parents approach sports today...it needs to be said."
Callie,Beaver,Coach,,,,,Parkville,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"I recommend this course because it makes you realize the impact you can have on a player's life in one season. It's not always about the wins, but building relationships with my players and making them better people."
Walter,Alvarenga,Coach,,,,,Fox Lake,IL,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"I would recommend this course for both new and old coaches that may be wondering how to reach their athletes and to reinforce some of the things they may already be doing. Thinking about funeral topics, and what really matters when it is all said and done and the impact that I could make after a career in teaching and coaching were the most valuable parts of this course."
Darryl,Reina,Coach,,,,,Newark,CA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I would certainly recommend the course as the process truly transforms your future direction as a coach. Unlocking character and having (and understanding) the process through the exercise of forecasting my coaching legacy was the most valuable part.
John,Rodriguez,Coach,,,,,Phoenix,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"As a coach of 30 years, 3D coaching has helped me to realize where I have failed in capturing the heart of my players and how I can fix it. I realized I have spent more time in the first and second levels and not nearly enough in the 3rd."
Jon,Duplessis,Coach,,,,,Wilmington,NC,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,It was valuable learning more about the 2nd and 3rd dimensions of coaching and helping me understand my purpose and the journey better. I would recommend this course to other coaches - much needed information for all coaches in today's teaching environment.
Miguel,Palacios,Coach,,,,,Glendale,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"YES, I recommend this course to other coaches. I do believe most of us coaches get bogged down in the Xs and Os and we neglect the human aspect of our players.I really appreciated the Codes of Conduct and the different strategies such as Spot Light and Journaling that I can use to add cohesion to our team."
Kim,Dever,Coach,,,,,Phoenix,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The most valuable thing i got out of taking the course was that coaching also happens off the field. I believe any coach or mentor would learn something new by taking this course.
Beery,Johnson,Principal,,,,,St. Joseph,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"Many times our coaches get so caught up in the X?s and O?s of the game, they lose the idea that most kids are out for the fun of the game. What 3D coaching does is to take the passion that coaches have and funnel it through a system that not only coaches them to have fun but also to teach character that will stay with athletes throughout their life in whatever fields they go into. It is a fantastic program that I would recommend to any school or athletic department."
Sandra,Hermann,Coach,,,,,Gilbert,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"The whole idea of teaching to the 3rd dimension was the most valuable part. We have always done this, but it gave me more ideas of what I can do to be even more successful."
Chris,Fritzsching,Detroit Lions Director of FB Education,,,,,Detroit,MI,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The impactful words and messages from each of the presenters.  I found myself stopping the videos to write down the messages exactly the way they were presented.  The material was presented in a way that hit home with me and will be a tremendous resource for me and our coaching staff to help reach our kids in ways they haven't been coached before.  Powerful and impactful!  Any youth/middle school/high school coach truly in coaching for the right reasons would tremendously benefit from this curriculum.  Impact kids in this way and you are bound to be successful despite the won-loss record. I absolutely recommend it and will certainly do so.
Mike,Crawford,Coach,,,,,Sioux City,IA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"This course provided valuable insights to make myself a better person and coach. Great tips on how to improve your coaching, relationships and communication with your players and parents."
James,Futch,Coach,,,,,Omaha,NE,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course was extremely informative and helpful when trying to gain an alternative perspective. The most valuable part of it for me was learning how to perceive my relationships with the athletes that I coach.
KC,Fouts,Coach,,,,,Council Bluffs,IA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,The tips on coaching the whole athlete and the ideas to coach beyond the foundational skills were the most valuable part of this course.
Ahmed,Shaker,Coach,,,,,Vancouver,WA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Yes! I recommend this course to other coaches! There are so many coaches that I have worked with that could use this to better coach not just their athletes but themselves as well. We can always learn something new and useful. It was valuable realizing that I have actually using a bit of the 3D coaching in my coaching all along and just how important it is to coach the whole child not just the athlete.
Gwen,Ford,Coach,,,,,Adrian,MO,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"This course got me to focus on what my goal is as a coach, outside of the sport itself. I recommend it to other coaches because I feel that taking the time to focus on how you live your life and your purpose makes my time as a coach more meaningful."
Cally,Bitterlin,Coach,,,,,Council Bluffs,IA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Learning how to communicate to students in a meaningful way was the most valuable thing I got out of taking this course. I recommend this to coaches because some of us still struggle creating those relationships needed to reach our students at a deeper level.
Sean,Murphy,Coach,,,,,Orlando,FL,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"This course was very impactful. It encourages the coach to appreciate the opportunity they have to positively impact the life of their players and the importance of capturing the heart, using strategies to build meaningful relations."
Sheldon,Cipriani,Coach,,,,,Winter Garden,FL,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"This course will change your life. It will make you a better husband, father, citizen and last but not least...a better coach."
Tara,Bauer,Coach,,,,,Chaska,MN,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course is a great tool to evaluate what you are doing as a coach and how things could be negatively impacting your outcomes and how implement tools for the season.
Kyle,Martin,Coach,,,,,Dunbar,PA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I absolutely recommend this course to other coaches. Coaching at another level, a level that engages student-athletes with a world outside of athletics. This program motivates coaches to build better, healthy citizens for their life. As a wrestling coach I can see the value of these strategies in ALL sports."
Travis,Clark,Coach,,,,,Fort Worth,TX,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,I found that I realized a lot of underlying factors in coaching that you don't normally see without someone pointing them out to you. It really helped me realize some of the things that I do or say and how they may come off to other individuals. I would recommend this course to other coaches.
Ben,Scott,Coach,,,,,Gilbert,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,The three levels of coaching were the most valuable part of this course. I had never thought to classify it like that. It went well for me.
Steve,Horton,Coach,,,,,Cibolo,TX,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The course opened my eyes to some of things I wasn't doing as far as coaching my youth athletes. It helped me understand how to coach and develop my young athletes for the long term instead of for the short-term. I have already suggested it to my other coaches in our youth program to help them better understand why I do the things that I do when it comes to coaching. I think it would benefit all of us to be on the same page as far as philosophy.
Kenneth,Hammond,Coach,,,,,Groveland,FL,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"All coaches should experience this course. Among other things, it highlights the relationship aspect of coaching and reveals coaches' deficiencies. The course emphasizes the attributes in the 2nd and 3rd dimensions that most coaches ignore and perhaps classify as intangibles. This course received my highest recommendation on all fronts."
Alex,Miranda,Coach,,,,,Clermont,FL,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I think this course should be a requirement for all aspiring coaches.  It is the foundation of our purpose in helping our youth. Allowed me to look deeper into my coaching purpose.  Now I have some thought when preparing my sessions.  It's just more than just drills.
Brian,Ascheman,Coach,,,,,Shakopee,MN,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The funeral topics course was a great ending to the entire course.  The course definitely provided a lot of tools that I will use for many future years. This is a well-rounded course that enables coaches to think beyond the 1st dimension.  Great course.  All three speakers were awesome.
Jamey,Spartz,Coach,,,,,Glendale,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,I recommend this course because it really opens up your eyes and helps you become a better coach and hope that these coaches see that we need to continue to be a better coach and work on our own self-development to be a better coach! It was valuable recognizing there are many aspects of coaching that most coaches chooses not to focus and how it is pleasing to see that there are some great coaches out there because they want to impact athletes and help them go through obstacles and not focus on the wins and losses!
Erick,Garcia,Coach,,,,,Apopka,FL,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,I am old school coach and this opened my eyes on doing things a different way. The most valuable part to me was talking about how and why to encourage your players.
Nick,Reed,Coach,,,,,Springfield,IL,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,I really enjoyed the journey to the development of my transformational purpose statement. I'd love to see this multiply to athletic programs everywhere.
Andrew,Staicer,Coach,,,,,Vista,CA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I would absolutely recommend this course to other coaches. I would love to make it a requirement for mine in every sport that I coach. Putting it all into perspective was the most valuable part. I think that there were a few eye openers even for someone like me who believes in positive coaching. Also understanding now why this generations family structure makes a difference.
Curt,Knowles,Coach,,,,,San Marcos,CA,,United States,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The continued re-affirmation of what sport brings to a person as a life lesson. The breakdown of the second dimension and the third dimension has really made a lasting impression on what I am teaching the athletes. I absolutely recommend this to other coaches. It really puts the priorities in perspective. I think the biggest lesson I have learned is the more you reach an athlete in the second and third dimension; the better they perform in the first dimension. Superb.
Michael,Fowler,Coach,,,,,Gilbert,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I'd recommend this course to other coaches. It makes you re-evaluate your purpose as a coach.
Ron,Schmittling,Coach,,,,,Edwardsville,IL,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,It is vital that all coaches understand and apply this material for their athletes success.
Jennifer,Galloway,Coach,,,,,Knoxville,TN,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I would recommend this course to other coaches. It not only makes you think about the reason why it makes you write it down and forces you to actually plan stuff. Most trainings just give you all the information and don't make you plan stuff out. Writing out the stuff we want people to say at our funeral followed closely by the transformation statement was the most valuable part for me.
Kevin,Standerfer,Athletic Director,,,,,Snowflake,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The focus on helping/coaching in the 2nd and 3rd Dimensions.  I have been doing that a little without even knowing it. I will coach in all Three Dimensions now.
Nick,Cornell,Coach,,,,,Gilbert,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"This course is a GREAT reminder of how we are supposed to teach and coach and the awesome responsibility that we each have as coaches. The reminder that what I do on a daily basis is the most important job in the world. To help my student's / athletes to be the very best that they can be both in sport and in life is critical. Lastly, my job is to love each and every student that I teach / coach."
Scott,Cook,Coach,,,,,Gilbert,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I think it is a great opportunity for coaches to look at how they work with their teams and players. It confirmed many of the things I have believed in and tried to do over the years. It also gave me new ideas to use.
Ryan,Salazar,Coach,,,,,Gilbert,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I recommend this course because I think it provokes reflection to be a better mentor. I like learning about the different perspectives that coaches had about programs and athletes.
Catherine,Dennis,Coach,,,,,Gilbert,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I felt the most valuable thing I learned that it is much more powerful to the athlete to feel loved, then it is to be rewarded for their success. I feel this course really changes the way we want to reach our kids and stears away from the traditional old-school way of coaching."
Ryan,Freeman,Coach,,,,,Mesa,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The strategies have already started to help the athletes that I am working with. The most valuable part was thinking of other ways to reach and teach all athletes.
Shawn,Dukes,Coach,,,,,Queen Creek,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"This course has been a soul searching journey for me. Allowing me to develop and build a strong program that shows the hearts of its members. It showed me the importance of coaching the entire athlete, not just the x's and o's."
Larry,Weier,Coach,,,,,Norwalk,IA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,It gives you a good out look about life itself - the importance of a coach in our athletes life. We sometimes forget that.
Taylor,King,Coach,,,,,Gilbert,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"It is transformational and allows you to think critically about what coaches you have had growing up and how that influences what you think coaching is. Coaching is more than winning, Coaching is more than fundamentals."
Adam,Manz,Coach,,,,,Council Bluffs,IA,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I recommend this course to other coaches. It allows you to reflect upon current practices and begin improving as a coach all around.
Terry,Fair,Coach,,,,,San Tan Valley,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I recommend this course to other coaches. A lot of valuable information and an opportunity for introspect.
Max,Ragsdale,Coach,,,,,Gilbert,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I recommend this course to other coaches so they too can have positive interactions with their teams. I acquired knowledge to improve my team's morale and joy.
Miner,Webster,Coach,,,,,Gilbert,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I absolutely recommend this course. Developing core values and creating a plan to emphasize these in our program was the most valuable part.
Erica,Duckett,Coach,,,,,Gilbert,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,YES! I recommend this course. It allows you to see other strategies used that you can implement into your own coaching. What I am doing is two-dimensional and I have a lot to still learn and grow with.
Crystal,Cook,Coach,,,,,Gilbert,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"Yes I would recommend this course to other coaches because I learned a lot of valuable coaching skills that I wouldn't normally learn. I also had the opportunity to learn from other coaches through the videos, meetings, and other coaches on campus. I'm a dance teacher on campus, so it was really awesome to have the opportunity to learn from other coaches from all sports."
Joe,Sanchez,Coach,,,,,Mesa,AZ,,,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"Very good, well organized and informational."
