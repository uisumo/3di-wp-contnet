I was so surprised that could barely articulate my question to him.  He was so pleasant and took the time to explain how my role in assisting the coaches is very important and shared great suggestions on how to write my statement.

Essentials is full of teasers for ""further details"" promised in the full certification course.
I was initially eager for the rest of the story, but these nuggets were difficult to find buried within a 30-hour course.
This includes mostly short video clips of solo speakers. Being a visual learner, I found myself frequently distracted by the speakers' mannerisms, video quirks (arbitrary changes of camera angle) and misspellings (""dissention""?) on graphics. The speeches seem universally over-acted, as if every speaker has been coached to (patronizingly) hand-sign every phrase.
I get that this is probably intended to mimic an in-person clinic (some clips include live audiences) and I approximated this experience by completing much of this course straight through (getting in another ""zone"" on a cold, rainy weekend when I lacked the energy to tackle anything else).
However, the course thus fails to take advantage of additional possibilities offered by the online medium. A simple transcript, for instance, would heighten retention (via simultaneous visual and auditory learning), speed understanding of the course framework, and enable quick reference for review. It would also allow for self-paced learning, and flexibility in navigating the course. (How many of us read any other coaching manual straight through?)

As i am finishing the course I’m  sitting emotional as tears well up in my eyes. This material, I believe bridges the gap between doing God’s will first (Matthew 6:33) and allowing people to nurture their inner child through play and sports and using their energy, especially the fight or flight energy our bodies were created with, in a positive and productive way that helps in their quest to honor their creator to teach, to be a friend and give everyone a sense and feeling of belonging, essentially what we have learned having played sports and been an athlete ourselves. Definitely, it is giving back what we were given. Jesus says it himself, “There’s more happiness in giving then there is in receiving.” We know this is in reference to the ‘word of Christ’ but it certainly paves the way for sharing that word and the love and friendship we desire ourselves. I’ve struggled for years to bridge the gap between competitive sports and Christianity, truth! In fact although having played every sport possible to stay on ‘the right path’ , before learning about the Bible truth in detail, my four sons only played maybe one sport each, except for the youngest. I was always concerned with bad association. This certainly is a great teacher, it’s amazing that it incorporates God’s word and teaching! I would have never thought it was possible. A foundation built on Gods word. How much stronger could it be ?? I often used the illustration to empower my sons to make the right choices (calculate risk/cost) that Jesus gave in Matthew 17:5, “ 
5 While he was still speaking, look! a bright cloud overshadowed them, and look! a voice out of the cloud said: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.+ Listen to him.”
And Luke 14:28 28 For example, who of you wanting to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the expense to see if he has enough to complete it?
Meaning if Jesus says building a foundation builds a strong tower (our future life) we can liken our future to that tower and our foundation is our education, job, place to live, a vehicle so that we may have something to contribute to a future spouse and family. 
I would say ty for all the hard work and energy put into this journey and ty personally for affecting my life in such a positive way!",Yes,3/22/2021 0:27

Each component is offered independently in manageable units, yet all the material is brought together superbly to create a complete and thorough understanding of the 3D framework. I have previous experience of the methodology behind 2nd and 3rd dimension approaches to coaching, yet the material in the course kept pulling me in for more. The one element of my coaching that has been lacking throughout the years has been the aspect of my Christianity in a multi-religious, and secular coaching environment. The FCA add-on material has been extremely motivational to me on a personal level, and I am indeed glad that I selected to have the add-on included in my course.

He knew his purpose and we all were the product of his investment...and had a lot of success across the board because of it. Has impacted my life since the day it all started. 3D has done a great job here of displaying in very practical ways -along with the 'technical research' of how to think/feel/know what 3D coaching is. Loved the journey. Well presented & had a nice rhythm/progression to it.  Feel I have more courage & hope to really become a better coach & 'better me'. Integrating the framework - fundamentals/mindset/heart - and the impact you can have is even more understood (i have needed to balance that...). Wow !!  Love rules the day - sacrificial giving for the sake of others...Be Great at being Good. Motivated to pursue & persist...the joy of the 'playground'. Filled my tank man...thank you and great work!!

The ""entitlement"" generation has been created by adults.  Adults have created what they now abhor.  As the course moved further along, the content improved.  It's a bit disconcerting to have content toward the end centered around FCA and God when that really shouldn't have anything to do with public school programming.  Even as a faithful Christian, I do not intermingle the two. My values and the way I treat people would certainly align, but it is not something I bring into our program.  I invite you to explore ways to eliminate that content or make it optional for those who want to explore it.  The third dimension is about heart, but that doesn't mean it has to involve God or faith in God.  In fact, it is important delineate between the two to best meet the needs of all coaches, athletes, and programs.

I don't know where I else I would find those resources or know how to implement them.  I also deeply value the 3rd dimension talk relating our purpose to our service of Christ. It is inspiring and I find myself watching it or listening to it over and over. This course provides specific direction and inspiration, and dare I say peace of mind of how to coach.

We all must continue to learn, grow, and exchange ideas with others. However, the focus of those sessions rarely reaches the personal level that it should. 3D Coaching does. When our coaches experienced 3D Coaching, there was substantial growth that took place. 3Dimensional Coaching focuses on the connections with kids and with people. It challenges coaches to get to the heart of an athlete. In my experience to date, I have not been a part of a more valuable professional development. As a result of this content, we implemented 3D Coaching Sessions that all coaches were welcome to attend. We met once a week for the remainder of the school year and are still doing so this summer. Those of us regulars have gotten a great deal from it. We have grown as coaches, and as people.

I had the opportunity to read the book last year and take the course this summer.  It allowed me to look over the notes I highlighted from the book while watching the videos.  I also liked the spiritual reflection with Jeff and Mark to take it to another dimension.  I had a purpose statement prior to the course as required by the Minnesota State High School League after hearing Dr. Jeff Duke speak in person, had the opportunity to meet him and started this journey.  After taking this course I revised my purpose statement with much more meaning.  Overall a sense of self-reflection to become a whole coach in the 3-dimensions. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course to other coaches! I think it is a course that every coach should take and reflect back before every season.

It opened the eyes and inspired our young coaches and veteran coaches as well to be great leaders of athletes and be a positive influence in impacting many lives as a coach.  The 3D Coaching workshop directly applied to every coach as it did not focus on the X and O's of a particular sport, but focused on motivating student athletes in a positive way.  This area is a huge challenge for coaches when dealing with the modern day athlete.  Veteran and young coaches alike on our staff commented to me that it was a very valuable use of their time and they were glad that they had attended after the workshop was over.  Wes is a great speaker and interacted with our coaches in an engaging manner.

This course digs considerably deeper in ways to reach our kids and somewhat forces the coach to get an idea of how, what, why, etc. we should be coaching 3-dimensionally. I was intrigued, and subsequently, am a better coach already, having seen a fraction of 3D Coaching over the Summer at Silver College for USA Wrestling at University of Wisconsin. Incidentally, I was exposed to intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation. I have competed nearly my entire life and never really 'got' how my own sons were never overly excited to wander around in their medals after a long tourney. Looking at the whole picture, I see that they are wrestling...for intrinsic purposes. They enjoy the competition, trying their takedowns, 'the sport,' and the 'game.' Knowing the difference, I am able to motivate much better, but, again, am validated in my own, already built, system for wrestling: (1.)FOUNDATION: We will build a foundation, fundamentally-strong, that will easily translate to any program, (2.) SUCCESS: We will help define success based on our athletes' unique skills/needs and, then, help them find it. (3.) FUN: perhaps, most-important, we will teach, learn, and compete in a way that is fun for all involved.",Yes,12/22/2015 10:47

Jennifer,Aguirre,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"This course give great insight on how to be a great coach, how to build relationships and different strategies to use.",Yes,8/31/2016 11:47
Jason,Schonberg,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I would recommend this course because it breaks down the generational gap many coaches are likely experiencing with the social media generation. We have to reach these kids through another strategy than the past.,Yes,9/4/2016 11:47
Bo,Hampton,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I think this course opens the eyes of coaches and helps us to become a better coach. Learning that coaching is about more than just teaching wrestling was the most valuable part to me.,Yes,9/6/2016 11:47
Amy,Becicka,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I would recommend this not only to coaches, but parents and any other professionals that work with kids. This is a much needed change in the mindset of what society believes about kids in athletics today.",Yes,9/10/2016 11:47
Kyle,Dalvit,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course offers a lot of valuable strategies that coaches can implement immediately. The combination of inspirational stories and practical strategies was the most valuable part.,Yes,9/17/2016 11:47
Kate,Gordon,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This was by far one of the most reflective experiences I've ever had as a coach. The reflection on my purpose in coaching and how to make the greatest impact on my athletes' lives was the most valuable part. I definitely recommend it.,Yes,9/17/2016 11:47
Tony,Moceri,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I see this is a very important way to keep youth involved in sports so they can get the positive messages and build those relationships.,Yes,9/17/2016 11:47
Keith,Galloway,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,This is something that all coaches can benefit from. The most frustrating thing a coach can deal with are heart issues.

Zach,Merrill,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I highly recommend this course for coaches. I definitely found the diamond among the roughs when it comes to coaching materials. Any coach can say, 'do this and that,' and you'll win guaranteed. However, this course teaches us that when you coach for developing the whole athlete (the spiritual, psychological, and physiological aspects), that's when you truly make a real difference in each of their lives. Learning about what it truly means to coach on the 2nd and 3rd dimension was the most valuable part. Skills that transcend coaching on the 1st dimension, which almost any coach can do. But coaching on the 2nd and 3rd dimension truly takes upstanding character, which we can cultivate and develop to produce other upstanding characters.",Yes,10/7/2016 11:47
Cole,Dishman,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"I feel validated in some of the things I have been doing for my programs over the years.

Marcus,Cobbs,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"Team Cohesion is something that my team has been struggling with, and this helped me out a great deal with what to do for that.

Ben,MacKay,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I have always felt that the most important aspects of coaching are the impact you can have on the lives of athletes. This reinforced that ideal and expanded my perspective tremendously. Additionally, this course gives tangible tools to implement the ideals. I'm excited to be on this journey. I'm going to recommend it to our club's director of coaching.",Yes,11/10/2016 10:47
Michael,McMasters,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"I would absolutely recommend this course! I don't feel that it is appropriate for an adult to coach a child unless the well-being of the child is their reason for being there. A coach who goes through this training would have to look at what they're doing, and ask themselves why they were there at all. A clearly delineated understanding of the various levels of coaching, as well as specific definitions that were backed up with research, were the most valuable thing to me. I loved that these weren't just 'common sense' approaches and that they had foundations in research.",Yes,11/13/2016 10:47
Michael,Duran,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course is very enlightening and offers much value to coaches. Recognizing that we must evolve! We can not continue coaching in the first dimension alone.,Yes,11/19/2016 10:47

Callie,Beaver,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"I recommend this course because it makes you realize the impact you can have on a player's life in one season. It's not always about the wins, but building relationships with my players and making them better people.",Yes,11/29/2016 10:47
Joe,Tabios,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"I recommend this course because because I know a lot of folks that when they are coaching are only doing it in the 1st dimension, and not really taking anything else into consideration.  Connecting with players and realizing they are people too, and not just a tool to win shouldn't have to be a spoken thing, but with how coaches and parents approach sports today...it needs to be said.",Yes,11/29/2016 10:47
Darryl,Reina,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I would certainly recommend the course as the process truly transforms your future direction as a coach.

Jon,Duplessis,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,It was valuable learning more about the 2nd and 3rd dimensions of coaching and helping me understand my purpose and the journey better.

John,Rodriguez,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"As a coach of 30 years, 3D coaching has helped me to realize where I have failed in capturing the heart of my players and how I can fix it. I realized I have spent more time in the first and second levels and not nearly enough in the 3rd.",Yes,12/5/2016 10:47
Kim,Dever,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The most valuable thing i got out of taking the course was that coaching also happens off the field. I believe any coach or mentor would learn something new by taking this course.,Yes,12/12/2016 10:47
Miguel,Palacios,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"YES, I recommend this course to other coaches. I do believe most of us coaches get bogged down in the Xs and Os and we neglect the human aspect of our players.I really appreciated the Codes of Conduct and the different strategies such as Spot Light and Journaling that I can use to add cohesion to our team.",Yes,12/12/2016 10:47
Sandra,Hermann,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"The whole idea of teaching to the 3rd dimension was the most valuable part. We have always done this, but it gave me more ideas of what I can do to be even more successful.",Yes,12/13/2016 10:47
Beery,Johnson,Principal,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"Many times our coaches get so caught up in the X?s and O?s of the game, they lose the idea that most kids are out for the fun of the game. What 3D coaching does is to take the passion that coaches have and funnel it through a system that not only coaches them to have fun but also to teach character that will stay with athletes throughout their life in whatever fields they go into. It is a fantastic program that I would recommend to any school or athletic department.",Yes,12/13/2016 10:47
Mike,Crawford,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"This course provided valuable insights to make myself a better person and coach. Great tips on how to improve your coaching, relationships and communication with your players and parents.",Yes,12/28/2016 10:47
Chris,Fritzsching,Detroit Lions Director of FB Education,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The impactful words and messages from each of the presenters.  I found myself stopping the videos to write down the messages exactly the way they were presented.  The material was presented in a way that hit home with me and will be a tremendous resource for me and our coaching staff to help reach our kids in ways they haven't been coached before.  Powerful and impactful!  Any youth/middle school/high school coach truly in coaching for the right reasons would tremendously benefit from this curriculum.  Impact kids in this way and you are bound to be successful despite the won-loss record. I absolutely recommend it and will certainly do so.,Yes,12/28/2016 10:47
James,Futch,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,This course was extremely informative and helpful when trying to gain an alternative perspective. The most valuable part of it for me was learning how to perceive my relationships with the athletes that I coach.,Yes,12/29/2016 10:47
KC,Fouts,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,The tips on coaching the whole athlete and the ideas to coach beyond the foundational skills were the most valuable part of this course.,Yes,12/30/2016 10:47
Ahmed,Shaker,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,Yes! I recommend this course to other coaches! There are so many coaches that I have worked with that could use this to better coach not just their athletes but themselves as well. We can always learn something new and useful. It was valuable realizing that I have actually using a bit of the 3D coaching in my coaching all along and just how important it is to coach the whole child not just the athlete.,Yes,1/1/2017 10:47
Gwen,Ford,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"This course got me to focus on what my goal is as a coach, outside of the sport itself.

Sean,Murphy,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,"This course was very impactful.

Travis,Clark,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,I found that I realized a lot of underlying factors in coaching that you don't normally see without someone pointing them out to you.

Steve,Horton,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,The course opened my eyes to some of things I wasn't doing as far as coaching my youth athletes. It helped me understand how to coach and develop my young athletes for the long term instead of for the short-term. I have already suggested it to my other coaches in our youth program to help them better understand why I do the things that I do when it comes to coaching. I think it would benefit all of us to be on the same page as far as philosophy.,Yes,3/5/2017 10:47
Kenneth,Hammond,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"All coaches should experience this course.

This course received my highest recommendation on all fronts.",Yes,3/8/2017 10:47

Alex,Miranda,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I think this course should be a requirement for all aspiring coaches.  It is the foundation of our purpose in helping our youth. Allowed me to look deeper into my coaching purpose.  Now I have some thought when preparing my sessions.  It's just more than just drills.,Yes,3/11/2017 10:47
Erick,Garcia,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,I am old school coach and this opened my eyes on doing things a different way. The most valuable part to me was talking about how and why to encourage your players.,Yes,3/12/2017 11:47
Jamey,Spartz,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,4,I recommend this course because it really opens up your eyes and helps you become a better coach and hope that these coaches see that we need to continue to be a better coach and work on our own self-development to be a better coach!

The breakdown of the second dimension and the third dimension has really made a lasting impression on what I am teaching the athletes. I absolutely recommend this to other coaches. It really puts the priorities in perspective. I think the biggest lesson I have learned is the more you reach an athlete in the second and third dimension; the better they perform in the first dimension. Superb.,Yes,3/15/2017 11:47
Andrew,Staicer,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,I would absolutely recommend this course to other coaches. I would love to make it a requirement for mine in every sport that I coach.

It not only makes you think about the reason why it makes you write it down and forces you to actually plan stuff. Most trainings just give you all the information and don't make you plan stuff out.

Nick,Cornell,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"This course is a GREAT reminder of how we are supposed to teach and coach and the awesome responsibility that we each have as coaches.

Robert,Bovaird,Head Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"Since becoming a coach at the age of 18, I've always known that my biggest weaknesses goes beyond teaching the fundamentals, the techniques, the movements of wrestling. I struggled year after year to find a way to fill the gaps in my coaching philosophies and practices. I'd had seasons when we nearly came out with top finishes for our program, and I'd had seasons when we nearly bottomed out. I always walked away with that bad taste in my mouth, that taste that would keep me up late at night questioning myself. Had I done the right things? Was I the right coach for this job? Was it time to step away and hand the reins to someone more able-bodied? Yet year after year, I received enough affirmations from parents and former wrestlers that I kept going. Through a series of difficulties and doubting moments, I happened to end up taking the 3 Dimension Coaching Course. I'm proud to say that much of WHAT I believed has been affirmed through the course, but even more so, I now have a much clearer idea and vision of HOW I can help my athletes.

Martin,Kafka,"Coach, Methodology Specialist",,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"It is absolutely amazing course! A thing of a genius of this philosophy and approach is the wholeness. Probably coaches have heard about the individual components that this course speaks about, but the very strong point of it is that you see it in its wholeness as a system in which everything fits in. I would use a metaphor: The individual components that this course speaks about are like individual parts of a human body (arm, leg, head, etc.). I think coaches have read or heard about them and thus they know them. But after this course the coaches will not see just the parts of the body, they will see the whole body. And thus they will understand why the body has its parts, what is their function, so they will know how to use them. So the coach will become a Coach.

Phillip,Tran,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,"Seeing and hearing Joe Ehrmann and Jeff Duke speak many years ago during keynote presentations at coaching conventions drastically improved my coaching skills.  The 3D Institute brings together the coaching philosophies of Jeff Duke, Joe Ehrmann, and many others and teaches it to coaches worldwide so they can effectively reach the hearts and minds of athletes.  

Over the years, I have implemented many 3D strategies and every single one of them have been wildly successful in positively shaping the cultures of the teams I have coached.  Any coach who is good enough to play a sport in college can pickup on any X's and O's they need to know in a day and many can talk about the X's and O's nonstop.  However, the more challenging task is forging strong leaders and shaping organizational culture.  Coaches who really want to develop leaders must be intentional about the process and the 3D framework shows you how to do so.  

I have seen too many coaches get into the game simply because they like the X's and O's.  Not every coach I know will be willing, committed, and intentional about leadership development to the level 3D demands.  The ones who are committed and intentional about leadership development will dominate the game and beyond.  

If I am ever the Head Coach of my own football program, 3D Coaching Certification will be mandatory for all of my assistants.  It is that good.  It is that necessary.",Yes,12/25/2018 10:47

Jarrod,Nelson,Coach,,&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733;,5,Just three years ago I had no intent to coach let alone becoming a head coach.  Having helped coach a youth program as part of student athlete coaches giving back to build the program I was comfortable with just helping.  I soon concluded that the other coaches not only didnt have experience playing the sport they were coaching but no experience coaching other than helping for a year or two with the current program.  To add to it the head coach was over commited to other programs and state level youth programs and was looking to find a suitable replacement.  I started making notes to what we should practice and how we should condition and that led to me being asked to take the team over.  It started off well and great effort and improvement however my skills as a coach were from twenty years ago as a highschool student and more suited for highschool athelets and adult learning.  Looking back I seen what this coures considers 3D coaching but didn't really acknowledge how and why.  As I found training courses for myself and my assistant coaches I found this course and not only does it follow teachings of my professional life but what I was exposed to long ago.  The intent is not only will the assistant coaches complete the sport specific certifications I have already mandated but also work their way to completing this course to ensure we are focused on the athletes developement not just in sport but in life.  Our program is an investment in the future program not a sell out results now program.
